  The epidemiology of chronic viral infections such as those caused by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is affected by the risk group structure of the infected population. Risk groups are defined by each of their members having acquired infection through a specific behavior. However risk group definitions say little about the transmission potential of each infected individual. Variation in the number of secondary infections is extremely difficult to estimate for HCV and HIV but crucial in the design of efficient control interventions. Here we describe a novel method that combines epidemiological and population genetic approaches to estimate the variation in transmissibility of rapidly-evolving viral epidemics. We evaluate this method using a nationwide HCV epidemic and for the first time co-estimate viral generation times and superspreading events from a combination of molecular and epidemiological data. We anticipate that this integrated approach will form the basis of powerful tools for describing the transmission dynamics of chronic viral diseases and for evaluating control strategies directed against them.

  Author Summary
  To design strategies that efficiently mitigate an epidemic requires estimates of how many people each carrier is likely to infect what is the variation of this number among infections and what is the time needed for these transmissions to take place. The disciplines of epidemiology and population genetics independently provide partial answers to these questions by analysing surveillance data and molecular sequences respectively. Here we propose a novel integration of the two fields that can reveal the underlying transmission dynamics of rapidly-evolving viruses such as HIV or HCV. We explore a well-described nationwide HCV epidemic and show that our method provides new insights into the nature and variation of HCV transmission among infected individuals. We suggest that this approach could form the basis of new tools that can help in the design of effective public health interventions targeting the spread of viral pathogens.

  (1) Objectives: French Guiana is the French territory most affected by sickle cell disease (SCD). This study investigates the associations between different environmental factors relative to climate infectious outbreaks and emergency visits or weekly hospital admissions for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). The identification of risk factors would lead to better patient care and patient management and more targeted prevention and therapeutic education for patients with SCD in French Guiana. (2) Methods: This study was performed using data collected from the medicalized information system and emergency medical records of Cayenne General Hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016. ARIMA models were used to investigate the potential impact of weather conditions and flu epidemics on VOC occurrence. (3) Results: During the study period 1739 emergency visits were recorded among 384 patients of which 856 (49.2%) resulted in hospitalization 811 (46.6%) resulted in hospital discharge and 72 (4.2%) in another orientation. Decreased temperature and decreased humidity were both independent factors associated with an increase of VOC cases (
   p = 0.0128 and 
   p = 0.0004 respectively). When studying severe VOC (leading to hospitalization with or without prior emergency visit) 2104 hospital admissions were recorded for 326 patients. The only factor associated with severe VOC in the multivariate analysis was flu epidemics (
   p = 0.0148). (4) Conclusions: This study shows a link between climate flu epidemics and VOC in French Guiana. Patient’s awareness of risks related to climate and flu epidemics should be encouraged as home prevention measures can help avoid painful crises. Moreover physicians should encourage patients to get immunized for influenza every year.

  Summary
  Since its discovery in 1947 in Uganda and control and eradication efforts have aimed at its vectors (
   Aedes mosquitoes) in Latin America in the 1950s an absolute neglect of Zika programs and interventions has been documented in 
   Aedes endemic and epidemic-prone countries. The current unprecedented Zika viral epidemics and rapid spread in the Western hemisphere pose a substantial global threat with associated anxiety and consequences. The lack of safe and effective drugs and vaccines against Zika or dengue epidemics further buttresses the realization from the West Africa Ebola outbreak that most emerging disease-prone countries are still poorly prepared for an emergency response. This paper examines knowledge gaps in both emerging and neglected arthropod-borne flavivirus infectious diseases associated with poverty and their implications for fostering local national and regional emerging disease preparedness effective and robust surveillance–response systems sustained control and eventual elimination. Strengthening the regional and Global Health Flavivirus Surveillance-Response Network (GHFV-SRN) with other models of socio-economic climatic environmental and ecological mitigation and adaptation strategies will be necessary to improve evidence-based national and global maternal–child health agenda and action plans.

  Viruses including the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the current COVID-19 epidemic are a key to the understanding of life and evolution. Cells may have arisen from aqueous sequestration inside a lipid envelope studded with chromophores capable of capturing solar photons. Nitrogen incorporation in the primordial cell chemistry allowed synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids a prelude to RNA and subsequently DNA. Metagenomics provides access to nucleoprotein sediments synthesised by a googol of metabolically differentiated cells that have marked the evolution of life. Replication of a virus a nucleoprotein particle occurs passively in competent cells. Viruses are only identified in the context of the epidemic that they induce as a result of transmission from one host to another. By breaking down the viral particle the host cell appears to resurrect the metabolic function of the nucleic acid which synthesises its components without any form of control. Viral products undergo self-assembly and are exported by either exocytosis or cytolysis. In the absence of cells viruses appear to be inert. However intracellular contamination of a virus does not always result in replication: the viral genome can disappear remain latent wake up remain embedded in the cellular genome become an oncogene or induce auto-immunity. The presence of endogenous retroviruses in eukaryotic cells raises the question of their possible role in evolution.
