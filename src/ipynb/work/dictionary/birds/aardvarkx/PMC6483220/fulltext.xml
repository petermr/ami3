Specifically, osteohistological examination of common fauna can be used to infer growth strategies of biologically uncommon, threatened, or extinct vertebrates. Although nine-banded armadillo biology has been studied extensively, work on growth history is limited. Here we describe long bone microstructure in tibiae and femora of a limited ontogenetic series of nine- banded armadillos (<italic>Dasypus novemcinctus</italic>) to elucidate patterns of bone growth. The cortex of the smallest individual is composed of compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB) and woven tissue. Extensive cortical drift is driven by periosteal erosion and further compaction of trabeculae resulting in an increase in the amount of CCCB. The cortex of the largest specimens is primarily CCCB with thickened endosteal bone and thin outer cortices of lamellar and parallel-fibered tissue. The outer cortices of the largest individuals are interpreted as an external fundamental system (EFS) indicating a cessation of appositional bone growth corresponding to skeletal maturity (i.e. asymptotic or adult size). The EFS forms in femora prior to tibiae, indicating femoral growth rates begin decreasing earlier than tibial in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic>. Growth trends in common fauna like the nine-banded armadillo can be used as a foundation for understanding life histories of related, but uncommon or extinct, species of cingulates.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the Undergraduate Scholars Program at Montana State University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.montana.edu/usp/">http://www.montana.edu/usp/</ext-link>).

Xenarthra is composed of sloths (Folivora), anteaters (Vermilingua), and armadillos (Cingulata). Cingulata contains all modern armadillos (Dasypodidae and Chlamyphoridae) and two extinct sub-families nested within Chlamyphoridae: Glyptodontinae and Pampatheriinae [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Currently, only eight of the 20 extant species of armadillo, including the nine-banded armadillo, are listed as Least Concern in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and an additional five species lack sufficient data for assessment [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. General biological, ecological, and physiological characteristics of a species must be understood in order to successfully implement conservation strategies [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite a recent increase in armadillo studies, gaps in armadillo research continue to inhibit conservation efforts due to difficulties in observing and tracking individuals in the wild and maintaining individuals in captivity [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we describe growth patterns in wild <italic>Dasypus novemcinctus</italic> through analysis of long bone microstructure for their potential utility in future ecological, biological, and paleontological studies of cingulates.</p><p>Analysis of bone microstructure can elucidate life history details of animals that are difficult to observe in the wild because bone microstructure can reveal phylogenetic, biomechanical, ontogenetic, and environmental signals [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, cyclical growth marks and annuli (e.g., lines of arrested growth or LAGs) within the bone indicate annual cessation of growth or, in the case of annuli, a slowing of appositional bone growth, and patterns of vascularity can be used to interpret relative growth rates by way of Amprino&#x02019;s Rule [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Previous work on bone microstructure in armadillos focused primarily on armadillo dermal armor [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, several studies include descriptions of bone microstructure in the appendicular skeleton of armadillos. Queckett [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] described osteonal arrangement in the humerus of <italic>Dasypus peba</italic> and the tibia and mandible from <italic>Glyptodon clavipes</italic>. Quekett [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] noted that the humerus consisted of obliquely oriented Haversian canals and the tibia of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>clavipes</italic> featured small osteons relative to the size of the tibia. Recently, Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] examined phylogenetic differences in the long bone microstructure throughout Xenarthra. The extensive sample from Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] encompassed various long bones from a broad range of taxa, including the nine-banded armadillo. However, comparing long bone microstructure across multiple species is difficult when ontogenetic studies are absent, especially because bones may undergo drastic morphological changes (e.g. muscle scarring, trochanteric growth, lengthening and/or thickening of shaft) through ontogeny. Cortical drift shapes the bone by resorption, differential deposition of new bone tissue, and perimedullary remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Nine-banded armadillos are a relatively new and yet common faunal element in the southern United States, emigrating northward from Central America into Texas in the mid nineteenth century [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Their range has continued to expand north through Tennessee, Nebraska, South Carolina, and individuals have been found as far north as South Dakota and Minnesota [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. According to Humphrey [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and as corroborated by Taulman and Robbins [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], annual precipitation may be more of a limiting factor than temperature. Changes in climate could extend the armadillo&#x02019;s potential range further north or alter growth dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Understanding broad patterns of growth dynamics in the nine-banded armadillo can aid in elucidating geographical differences in growth and the effect of climate and environment on armadillo bone development. The study by Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] histologically sampled the femur and humerus from two individuals of nine-banded armadillos and an additional humerus from a third individual. All three nine-banded armadillos examined in that study were categorized as adults by the researchers based on epiphyseal fusion and, after histological examination, the presence of an external fundamental system (EFS). Thus far, this is the only extensive histological analysis done on armadillos. Here we build upon that study by describing the hindlimb bone microstructure of a limited ontogenetic series of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic> in order to build foundational work on armadillo bone growth dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Institutional abbreviations</title><p>University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA (UTCM); Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, Norman, Oklahoma, USA (OMNH).</p></sec><sec id="sec004" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Skeletal elements sampled for this study were obtained from the collections of University of Tennessee-Chattanooga and Sam Noble Museum of Natural History. No animals were sacrificed for this study, therefore, IACUC approval was not necessary. We sampled left femora and tibiae from six nine-banded armadillos (<italic>Dasypus novemcinctus)</italic> representing a limited ontogenetic series. Empirical intraskeletal studies have demonstrated that larger weight bearing bones preserve higher apposition rates than non-weight bearing bones and thus, can be used as a proxy for yearly increases in body mass [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0215655.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Individuals sampled were originally collected as road kill. Road kill specimens have been used in demographic and morphological nine-banded armadillo studies to alleviate difficulties in tracking and capturing specimens, although accurate body mass measurements are difficult to obtain due to the oft-scattered condition of these specimens [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Loughry and McDonough [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also note that although roadkill specimens are convenient, they may not represent an accurate view of population dynamics. We assume bone microstructure is not influenced by sidedness; left and right elements of the same type in an individual share similar osteohistological characters [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Quantitative morphological details of sampled elements can be found in <xref rid="pone.0215655.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Previously, epiphyseal fusion has been used to assess skeletal maturity based on observations of extant mammals e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, Parfitt [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] suggests epiphyseal fusion is the result of growth cessation and not the cause. Therefore, a partially fused epiphysis would indicate the long bone is skeletally mature and growth has ceased. The epiphyses of UTCM 801, UTCM 802, and OMNH 39188 were unfused in both elements and we tentatively identify these individuals as juveniles. The femur of UTCM 801 is lacking a distal epiphysis, but all other elements are complete. Conversely, the long bone epiphyses of UTCM 1557 and OMNH 40173 are nearly fused but have faintly visible suture lines and the long bones of OMNH 40175 are completely fused. UTCM 1557, OMNH 40173, and OMNH 40175 are thus labeled as adults. Collection date, collection locality, length measurements, and body mass of specimens are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0215655.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Complete cast replicas of each element were produced prior to histological preparation by molding and casting procedures outlined in Padian and Lamm [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Macro-photographs of individual elements were taken using a Nikon D60 DSLR equipped with an AF-S Nikkor 18- 55mm zoom lens.

The distal &#x02018;halves&#x02019; of femora and full tibiae/fibulae complexes were prepared using techniques outlined in Schweitzer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The third trochanter arises on the proximal shaft of the femur in armadillos and extends distally below the mid-diaphyseal region. Thus, two serial transverse sections of the embedded femora were removed distal to the third trochanter in an attempt to minimize interference from growth of the trochanter. Extension of bony processes such as trochanters and tubercles typically requires increased bone deposition in the region of those processes and are not representative of overall bone growth. Two transverse sections were removed from the diaphysis of the embedded tibiae distal to the apex of the tibial crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Two thin sections of approximately 1.4mm thickness were removed from each element and mounted to plastic slides. Slides were ground and polished to a thickness between 70&#x003bc;m and 100&#x003bc;m using a series of carbide grit papers on a lapidary wheel. After polishing, one slide from each element was stained with toluidine blue following protocol by Osborne and Curtis [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], except in step 4 staining in 1% toluidine blue solution was performed for 5 minutes and in step 6 differentiation in 70% EtOH was completed in a range of 3&#x02013;5 dips, depending on the rate of color change. Each stained thin section was then protected with a cover-slip to ensure the long-term preservation of the thin section. Toluidine blue was used to increase visibility and differentiation of lines of arrested growth (LAGs) and cement lines of secondary osteons. Toluidine blue staining was completed by the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Bozeman, Montana, USA (UTCM 801, UTCM 802, and UTCM 1557) and the Woodward Ballard Paleohistology Lab at Oklahoma State University-Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa, OK, USA. Thin section analyses were performed at the Woodward Ballard Paleohistology Lab on the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences campus (Tulsa, OK).

We stress that the organization of mineralized collagen fibers is on a continuum. Therefore, intermediate states of organization exist between the defined terms below. For example, tissue organization can be more organized than woven tissue but less organized than parallel-fibered tissue. Woven bone tissue consists of unorganized collagen fibers and is regionally isotropic in cross polarized light, in both transverse and longitudinal sections. Osteocyte lacunae in woven bone often appear &#x0201c;plump&#x0201d; (i.e. rounded) or irregularly shaped without clear major axis orientation. Lamellar tissue is composed of highly organized collagen fibers appearing as a plywood pattern and is anisotropic with high birefringence in cross polarized light, when fibers are arranged parallel to the plane of section; when perpendicular to the plane of section, they appear isotropic. However, recent analysis of lamellar tissue found collagen fibers interweaving within arrays composing a single lamella, despite the plywood patterning seen at a more macroscopic level [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Osteocyte lacunae within lamellar tissue are often sparse and appear elongated or flattened within the meshwork of lamellar tissue fibers, parallel to the plane of section [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Parallel-fibered tissue is anisotropic in cross polarized light when collagen fibers are parallel to the plane of section and appear isotropic if oriented perpendicular to the plane of section. Parallel-fibered tissue consists of collagen fibers arranged in parallel, often with elongated osteocyte lacunae. The mineralized collagen fibers in parallel-fibered tissue are arranged more or less parallel to each other, and so this tissue is more organized than woven tissue but less organized than lamellar tissue. However, parallel-fibered tissue can vary in regards to the degree of collagen fiber organization. As noted by Francillon-Viellot <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], &#x02018;&#x02026;there are intermediate categories between [parallel-fibered bone] and both woven bone and lamellar bone, as expressed in the level of the fibrillar arrangement&#x02019;. We use the term &#x0201c;loosely arranged parallel-fibered&#x0201d; to describe tissue that appears intermediate to parallel-fibered tissue and woven tissue. Tissue organization can be used to determine relative growth rates, and daily apposition rates have been observed for lamellar (&#x02264; 1&#x003bc;m/day), parallel-fibered (1 &#x003bc;m/day), and woven tissue (5&#x02013;171 &#x003bc;m/day) [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0215655.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0215655.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB) is a term applied to bone tissue formed when new bone fills in the spaces between existing trabeculae, subsequently compacting the cancellous layer of bone [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. CCCB is often formed of lamellar tissue deposited along trabecular surfaces, resulting in regions of both high and low birefringence in cross polarized light. Resulting features of the formation of CCCB can be irregularly shaped osteon-like formations, multitudes of tide lines throughout the tissue delineating un-resorbed trabeculae from more recently deposited lamellar tissue, and islands of calcified cartilage if the CCCB is near trabeculae formed in the metaphyseal region at an earlier ontogenetic stage, which has since migrated into the diaphysis through the process of diaphyseal elongation [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Islands of calcified cartilage were identified through toluidine staining and morphological consistencies with previous descriptions (see Fig 8.21 in [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]). Descriptions of tissue types follow these definitions unless noted otherwise.</p><p>Additional features include resorption lines, external fundamental system (EFS), and &#x0201c;metaplastic tissue&#x0201d;. Resorption lines result from deposition of tissue on a previously eroded surface. The resorption line often has a wavy appearance outlining previously existing Howship&#x02019;s lacunae formed from osteoclast activity. An external fundamental system (EFS) is an outer cortical layer of well-organized tissue representing a slowing and eventual cessation of cortical growth and, thus, skeletal maturity [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. An EFS is typically composed of avascular lamellar or parallel-fibered tissue with closely spaced growth marks, but can also be a thick annulus at the periosteal surface. &#x02018;Metaplastic tissue&#x02019; described herein refers to tissue that is morphologically consistent with metaplastic hard tissues defined and described in Haines and Mohuiddin [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] (termed &#x02018;metaplastic bone&#x02019;) and Horner <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Metaplastic hard tissues described below are likely the result of mineralizing tendinous fibers at a muscular attachment site (enthesis), termed intratendinous metaplastic tissue [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. However, due to our limited sample size and singular sampling location we cannot eliminate a cartilaginous origin for the metaplastic tissue. We attempt to note the presence of metaplastic tissue throughout our sample, but the extent and full investigation of this mineralized tissue is the subject of a future study. Likewise, periosteal attachment fibers (e.g. Sharpey&#x02019;s fibers), and associated fibrocyte lacunae, are found throughout our sample but will not be noted further and is beyond the scope of this paper.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec005"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec006"><title>UTCM 802</title><p>The femur of UTCM 802 has an endosteal layer of lamellar tissue of varying thickness. This layer is thickest along the medial and posterior sides. Regional endosteal resorption of the endosteal layer was occurring at the time of death on the lateral side as revealed by the intermittent presence of scalloped pitting along the endosteal surface. Woven tissue with dense osteocyte lacunae comprises the mid-cortex of the lateral side of the femur with primary osteons and vascular canals oriented longitudinally and obliquely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Few irregular secondary osteons are present in the woven tissue on the postero-lateral side. The mid-cortical woven tissue is separated from the endosteal layer by a resorption line indicating endosteal resorption of the woven tissue occurred prior to deposition of endosteal bone. Medially the woven tissue changes to CCCB as the major component of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The CCCB typically extends to the periosteal surface on the medial, posterior, and anterior sides. The outermost cortex consists of loosely arranged parallel-fibered tissue on the lateral corner. In cross polarized light, this outer cortex has high birefringence postero-laterally, but also numerous plump osteocyte lacunae. The outer cortex lacks birefringence on the antero-lateral portion of the lateral corner, possibly due to a shift in fiber organization to woven tissue or a change in orientation of parallel-fibered tissue. Vascular canals are simple or surrounded by primary osteons and are oriented longitudinally, occurring within the outer cortex and are more numerous in the isotropic region. Periosteal resorption is indicated by intermittent scalloped pitting on the periosteal surface along the posterior, antero-medial, and antero-lateral sides of the femur.</p><fig id="pone.0215655.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215655.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Osteohistological features of UTCM 802 femur and tibia.</title><p>(A) Anterolateral side of femur in circularly polarized light.

In general, the mid-cortex of the tibia is composed of woven tissue and CCCB. Within the mid-cortex of woven tissue are resorption cavities, frequent simple vascular canals, incipient primary osteons, and primary osteons surrounding longitudinal vascular canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This mid-cortical woven bone extends to the periosteal surface on the medial side. The mid-cortex of the anterior, lateral, and posterior sides of the tibia is CCCB with pockets of calcified cartilage concentrated posteriorly and laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The CCCB extends to the periosteal surface on portions of the lateral and anterior sides. The mid-cortex and endosteal layer of lamellar tissue are separated by a resorption line indicating endosteal resorption of the mid-cortex occurred prior to deposition of the inner lamellar tissue. An outer cortex of woven tissue with longitudinal vascular canals surrounded by primary osteons, as well as simple vascular canals, is visible along a posterior portion of the lateral side of the tibia.

Anteriorly, the outer cortex is parallel-fibered tissue with high birefringence but mostly plump osteocyte lacunae, but the parallel-fibered tissue does not continue along the entire anterior side due to the aforementioned CCCB extending to the periosteal surface anteriorly. Along with the outer cortex of woven tissue, the parallel-fibered tissue is separated from the mid-cortex by a resorption line; thus, periosteal erosion of the mid-cortex occurred prior to deposition of the outer cortex.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>UTCM 801</title><p>The femur of UTCM 801 has an incomplete endosteal layer of lamellar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). At the lateral corner the lamellar endosteal layer and innermost cortex is resorbed due to medullary drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The lamellar tissue is birefringent in cross polarized light on the medial side. Elsewhere, the endosteal layer contains primarily plump osteocyte lacunae and lacks birefringence, possibly due to a longitudinal orientation of collagen fibers. The endosteal layer has few simple vascular canals oriented longitudinally and radially. Overall the lamellar endosteal layer in UTCM 801 is not as extensive in thickness as in the femur of UTCM 802. The cortex of the femur is primarily CCCB and woven tissue. Similar to UTCM 802, woven tissue with numerous primary osteons and incipient primary osteons makes up the mid-cortex and outer cortex of the lateral corner and transitions to CCCB on the antero-medial and postero-medial sides. The woven tissue increases vascularity and lacunar density towards the periosteal surface. Primary osteons are present in the woven tissue and surround longitudinal vascular canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The woven tissue has resorption cavities and scalloping along the endosteal surface and is adjacent to the medullary cavity at the lateral corner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Elsewhere a resorption line separates the woven tissue from the endosteal lamellar tissue similar to UTCM 802. The mid-cortex of the medial side of the femur is CCCB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The CCCB continues around the anterior and posterior sides where the mid-cortex transitions to woven tissue laterally. Medially, the CCCB is separated from the endosteal layer by a resorption line indicating endosteal resorption of CCCB occurred prior to deposition of endosteal bone. The CCCB extends out to the periosteal surface along a stretch of the posterior side where woven tissue is not present. Calcified cartilage is found throughout the region of CCCB and identified via toluidine blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Unlike UTCM 802, an outer cortex composed of varying tissue organizations is present on the medial side and regions of the anterior and posterior sides of the femur, but absent from the apex of the lateral corner where the aforementioned woven tissue is present. The outer cortex is parallel-fibered postero-laterally with both plump and elongated osteocyte lacunae. The outer cortex is lamellar tissue on the postero-medial and medial side of the femur with very few simple longitudinal vascular canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Osteocyte lacunae are scarce in the outer lamellar tissue on the postero-medial and medial sides. The outer cortex lacks birefringence in cross polarized light postero-medially but is birefringent along most of the medial side. The outer cortex is disorganized woven tissue on the anterior side.

The mid-cortex of UTCM 1557 is CCCB and woven tissue with a few secondary osteons concentrated on the medial side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Regions of calcified cartilage in the CCCB are primarily located on the posterior side of the tibia, though several small areas are found medially and anteriorly. The tibia has an outer cortex of parallel-fibered tissue and woven tissue, being a thin region of parallel-fibered tissue around a majority of the lateral and anterior sides, but thicker on the posterior and medial sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The outer cortex of the posterior side is alternating regions of woven and parallel-fibered tissue. Longitudinally oriented vascular canals within primary osteons and simple vascular canals are found within the woven tissue components of the outer cortex. The outer cortex transitions to parallel-fibered tissue medially until transitioning to a thin region of avascular parallel-fibered tissue at the medial corner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Two growth marks, potentially a double LAG, are present in the outer cortex near the medial corner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). These growth marks do not continue around the entire circumference of the tibia. Osteocyte lacunae in the outer cortex at the medial corner are plump and the tissue is isotropic, likely due to collagen fibers running in parallel longitudinally. The outer cortex is separated from the CCCB by a resorption line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>OMNH 40173</title><p>The femur of OMNH 40173 has an incomplete endosteal layer of avascular lamellar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Resorption of the endosteal layer is intermittent on the lateral, anterior, and medial sides. Consistent with previous descriptions above, the mid-cortex of the femur is CCCB and woven tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g006">Fig 6A&#x02013;6C</xref>). The woven tissue is present on the lateral side and continues medially along the anterior and posterior sides until it transitions into CCCB. The woven tissue has longitudinal vascular canals within primary osteons, and secondary osteons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Resorption lines on the endosteal surface of the woven tissue indicates endosteal resorption of the woven tissue prior to deposition of the endosteal tissue. The outer cortex of the femur is composed of CCCB anteriorly and highly organized parallel-fibered tissue. The outer cortical parallel-fibered tissue is birefringent antero-laterally and postero-laterally but lacks birefringence at the apex of the lateral corner. We identify this is due to a shift in fiber direction, where the parallel-fibered tissue is oriented perpendicular to the plane of section at the apex and parallel to the plane of section elsewhere. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g006">Fig 6A&#x02013;6C</xref>). The parallel-fibered tissue component is likely the beginning of an EFS that is incomplete around the circumference of the bone. Vascularity in the outer cortex of parallel-fibered tissue consists of scarce primary osteons and longitudinally oriented simple vascular canals. There is an increase in vascularity in the outer cortex of the lateral corner. As in UTCM 1557, two hyper-mineralized lines are present in regions of the outer cortex. Unlike UTCM 1557, these are interpreted as two distinct LAGs due to spacing between the two hyper-mineralized lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215655.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0215655.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215655.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Osteohistological features of OMNH 40173.</title><p>(A) Anterior side of the femur of OMNH 40173 under circularly polarized light.

Our smallest sampled femur, UTCM 802 (femoral length = 77.20 mm), has endosteal resorption lines within the cortex indicating moments of cortical drift. Endosteal resorption lines are likewise found throughout our entire sample of femora. Resorption cavities within the cortex are present in all individuals sampled, decreasing in frequency in larger individuals. Resorption cavities are more numerous throughout the cortex in the lateral corner of the femur, where resorption and deposition occur more rapidly due to the close proximity of the third trochanter. The mid-cortex of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic> is composed mostly of CCCB with regions of primary woven tissue. Primary bone is resorbed both endosteally and periosteally throughout the femur, with the exception of the lateral corner, where only endosteal resorption occurred. All individuals have woven bone with longitudinal vascular canals in the lateral region and the number of secondary osteons in the lateral region increases through ontogeny. Vascularity in the lateral corner decreases in larger individuals and shifts to more longitudinally oriented canals within primary and secondary osteons. CCCB is formed from the infilling of cancellous bone, such as trabeculae, as the bone undergoes cortical drift. The extent of CCCB within the cortex increases throughout ontogeny in the femora of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic>. An external fundamental system composed of poorly vascularized lamellar and parallel-fibered bone is deposited intermittently on the periosteally eroded surface of the femur in the larger individuals sampled. The EFS appears to be deposited first along the postero-medial and antero-medial corners. Deposition of the EFS then continues on the medial side and antero-medial side before being deposited lastly along the posterior and lateral sides. The EFS is continuous around the entire circumference of femora from UTCM 1557 (femur length = 95.59mm) and OMNH 40175 (femur length = 99.7mm), but not OMNH 40173 (femur length = 97mm). The incomplete nature of the EFS in OMNH 40173 indicates appositional growth was still occurring at the time of death. Lack of an EFS in OMNH 40173, despite a femoral length comparable to UTCM 1557 and OMNH 40175, could be due to individual variation or sexual dimorphism (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">discussion</xref> below). The thickness of the cortex in the femur increases with size primarily as a result of thickening of the endosteal bone and deposition of the outer cortex of lamellar and parallel-fibered bone.</p><p>Bone microstructure in the tibia of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic> is similar to that of the femur. Resorption lines within the cortex indicate endosteal and periosteal resorption events due to cortical drift. The smallest individual, UTCM 802, has a mid-cortex of primary woven tissue and CCCB. The general trend is the extent of primary woven bone decreases through ontogeny and CCCB increases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215655.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The mid-cortex of larger individuals is composed of CCCB with regions of woven bone. Thickening of the cortex occurs in the tibia by formation of CCCB from the extensive network of trabeculae and deposition of lamellar and parallel-fibered bone along the periosteal surface. However, thickness of the CCCB and extensiveness of trabeculae are variable among individuals. The tibia of OMNH 40173 has fewer trabeculae than the other specimens and a well-defined endosteal layer of lamellar bone. An EFS of poorly vascularized lamellar and parallel-fibered bone appears first on the posterior side of the tibia in our limited ontogenetic series. The thickness of the EFS is highly variable between individuals and could be used as an indicator for relative age. The EFS then appears on the anterior side, followed by the lateral and then medial sides. Similar to the femora, an EFS is complete around the entire circumference of the tibiae from UTCM 1557 (tibia length = 78.23mm) and OMNH 40175 (tibia length = 78.9mm), but is incomplete in OMNH 40173 (tibia length = 76.5mm).

<italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic> undergo similar changes in growth according to our observations. Endosteal and periosteal erosion drives cortical drift with formation of CCCB. An outer cortex of lamellar and parallel-fibered bone is then deposited along eroded periosteal surfaces. However, thickness of the innermost cortex of endosteal bone is drastically different between the tibia and femur, with the femur typically having a much thicker endosteal layer of lamellar bone. This is likely due to the denser network of trabeculae found in the tibiae. An EFS is found in both tibiae and femora, but there appears to be intraspecific variation in regards to the extent and thickness of the EFS in both elements. For example, both the tibia and femur of OMNH 40173 have an incomplete outer cortical layer of well-organized tissue that we interpret as an incomplete, or incipient, EFS. The limited ontogenetic series suggests initial EFS deposition is discontinuous and regionally specific. Parfitt [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] suggested that fusion of the epiphyses is the result of growth cessation, thus, incomplete fusion would indicate skeletal maturity. Here, we found UTCM 1557 had nearly fused epiphyses but a complete EFS in both elements while OMNH 40173 had incomplete fusion and an incomplete EFS. EFS deposition seems to have occurred prior to epiphyseal fusion in UTCM 1557, but EFS deposition and epiphyseal fusion occurred concurrently in OMNH 40173. This suggests that further studies are needed to resolve the timing of epiphyseal fusion and diaphyseal osteohistological indicators of skeletal maturity.</p><p>The microstructural patterns of the nine-banded armadillo closely resemble those of the recently described <italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>, the aardvark [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Legendre and Botha-Brink [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] described the microstructure of various limb elements, including femora and tibiae, and found CCCB composing most of the cortex and a thin outer cortex of parallel-fibered and woven bone with few growth marks. Aardvarks and nine-banded armadillos are similar in that both are myrmecophagous, fossorial, and have relatively low metabolic rates compared to other mammals.</p><p>Recently, Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] described long bone microstructure throughout extant Xenarthra. Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] described the long bones of armadillos as having a general three-layer structure composed of inner lamellar and parallel-fibered bone, mid cortical parallel-fibered bone, and an outer lamellar and parallel-fibered bone layer with cyclical growth marks. In the present study, we found thick endosteal layers of lamellar and parallel-fibered bone comprising the innermost cortex in the largest individuals, in agreement with Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similar to the findings of Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we found an EFS composed of lamellar and parallel-fibered bone, and our largest specimens have cyclical growth marks, both complete and incomplete, within the EFS. However, individuals sampled in our study primarily had a mid-cortex of CCCB, incongruent with Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] noted &#x0201c;Secondary osteons are poorly differentiated and in certain areas irregularly shaped&#x0201d; when describing the mid-cortex. The irregularly shaped secondary osteons noted by Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] may instead be mid-cortical CCCB: infilling of cavities surrounding trabeculae during CCCB formation can lead to osteon-like structures with both irregular borders and distorted shape profiles. If CCCB was misidentified as secondary osteons by Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], that would explain the discrepancy in cortical organizations described between the present study and former study.</p><p>It may also be that our differing results from those of Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are due to the differences in the time taken to achieve skeletal maturity across the wide geographical range of armadillos [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Nine-banded armadillos often reduce activity on cold winter days, and thus lower food availability during winter months could limit growth [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our study included specimens collected from Tennessee, Georgia, and Oklahoma, but the collection locations of specimens used in Straehl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are unavailable for comparison. Because nine-banded armadillos living in regions with mild winters could be less limited by food availability, studies of growth strategy across the entire range of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus</italic> could reveal differing selective pressures on armadillo growth patterns [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>Our study also did not account for possible differences in growth rate based on sex. McDonough <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] did not find any significant difference in growth between sexes in a study on juvenile nine-banded armadillo growth. However, McDonough [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] did find a slight difference in body mass between genders during a study on a population of nine-banded armadillos in south Texas. We cannot address sexual dimorphism in the current study due to lack of data on the animals&#x02019; gender (gender is known only for 3 of our 6 specimens). Gender should be considered in future work on armadillo bone growth to determine if sexually dimorphic signals in the bone microstructure exist.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned shortcomings of age classification based on body mass, Loughry and McDonough [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] state, &#x02018;At present, there is no better way to more precisely age armadillos&#x02019;. The results of our study so far confirm this observation, as hindlimb bone microstructure does not appear useful in the aging of nine-banded armadillos due to the extensiveness of periosteal erosion, endosteal erosion, and CCCB due to cortical drift. However, incorporation of additional ontogenetic stages and other skeletal elements are necessary before the utility of osteohistology in age determination is assessed for armadillos.</p><p>Correlating known-age with growth trends in a species facilitates life history reconstruction [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Knowledge of a species&#x02019; life history is essential to developing accurate conservation and management strategies [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. For example, Marin-Moratalla et al. [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] used osteohistological analysis of long bones in <italic>Addax nasomaculatus</italic>, a critically endangered herbivore, to reconstruct life history traits for use in conservation management. Within Cingulata, seven species are either near-threatened or vulnerable, and five species lack sufficient data for population analysis [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using bone microstructural analysis to evaluate life history parameters can alleviate some of the need for field studies on elusive species. The nine-banded armadillo is representative of a difficult research subject and a good model on which to test osteohistological examination as a means to fill the gaps in our knowledge of their life history. Sampling the nine-banded armadillo along its entire geographic range may illuminate growth responses to varying climatic regimes, which can then be applied to more elusive cingulates for prediction of possible life history changes due to changing climates. As of now, age cannot be accurately determined in the nine-banded armadillo through osteohistological methods. It is possible that incorporation of additional ontogenetic stages could permit identification of patterns in the formation of CCCB, and a scale of relative maturity produced. Similarly, additional ontogenetic sampling of known-age individuals is required to test the utility of epiphyseal fusion as a means to determine relative age in the nine-banded armadillo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We examined changes in bone microstructure in tibiae and femora in an ontogenetic series (n = 6) of the nine-banded armadillo (<italic>D</italic>. <italic>novemcinctus)</italic>, with the intent that nine-banded armadillo osteohistology could be used as a comparative tool for reconstructing the life histories of biologically rare, threatened, or extinct cingulates. In ontogenetically younger individuals, femora and tibiae of nine-banded armadillos are generally composed of compacted coarse cancellous bone with regions of primary woven tissue. Periosteal and endosteal resorption and differential deposition occurs extensively as cortical drift takes place in older individuals. Drift and elongation also result in further compaction of cancellous bone previously located in the metaphysis [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Two specimens (UTCM 1557 and OMNH 40175) had a complete external fundamental system in both the tibia and femur, indicating cessation of linear growth and achievement of skeletal maturity. However, the presence of the EFS did not appear consistently in larger individuals, indicating individual variation in growth and timing of skeletal maturity. The three largest specimens had either a double-LAG (UTCM 1557 and OMNH 40175) or two distinct LAGs (OMNH 40173) in the outer cortex that did not continue around the entire circumference of the bone.</p><p>Unfortunately, the extensiveness of CCCB and periosteal erosion within tibiae and femora in our sample prevents accurate age determination from these elements, similar to findings from Legendre and Botha-Brink [<xref rid="pone.0215655.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The results of our pilot ontogenetic study suggest future histology examinations on armadillos and likely other cingulates should include earlier juveniles and control for gender, captivity status, season of death, and latitude, in order to determine the effects of each on long bone growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215655.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Transverse sections of sampled femora under linearly polarized light.</title><p>(A) UTCM 802, (B) UTCM 801, (C) OMNH 39188, (D) UTCM 1557, (E) OMNH 40173, and (F) OMNH 40175.
