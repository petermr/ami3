    "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to the localized dilatation of the infra-renal aorta, in which the diameter exceeds 3.0 cm. Loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular inflammation, and oxidative stress are hallmarks of AAA pathogenesis and contribute to the progressive thinning of the media and adventitia of the aortic wall. With increasing AAA diameter, and left untreated, aortic rupture ensues with high mortality. Collective evidence of recent genetic and epigenetic studies has shown that phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) towards dedifferentiation and proliferative state, which associate with the ECM remodeling of the vascular wall and accompanied with increased cell senescence and inflammation, is seen in in vitro and in vivo models of the disease. This review critically analyses existing publications on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the complex role of SMCs within the aortic wall in AAA formation and reflects the importance of SMCs plasticity in AAA formation. Although evidence from the wide variety of mouse models is convincing, how this knowledge is applied to human biology needs to be addressed urgently leveraging modern in vitro and in vivo experimental technology."
