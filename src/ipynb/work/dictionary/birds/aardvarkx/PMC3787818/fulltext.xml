reality and significance of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), especially by manufacturing
uncertainty over climate science. Books denying AGW are a crucial means of attacking climate science
and scientists, and we examine the links between conservative think tanks (CTTs) and 108 climate
change denial books published through 2010. We find a strong link, albeit noticeably weaker for the
growing number of self-published denial books. We also examine the national origins of the books and
the academic backgrounds of their authors or editors, finding that with the help of American CTTs
climate change denial has spread to several other nations and that an increasing portion of denial
books are produced by individuals with no scientific training. It appears that at least 90% of
denial books do not undergo peer review, allowing authors or editors to recycle scientifically
unfounded claims that are then amplified by the conservative movement, media, and political
elites.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change denial</kwd><kwd>conservative movement</kwd><kwd>conservative think tanks</kwd><kwd>denial books</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>No sooner had anthropogenic global warming (AGW) been placed on the public agenda, perhaps most
effectively by James Hansen&#x02019;s 1988 congressional testimony, than an organized campaign to deny its
reality and significance was launched. The early campaign was centered in corporate America,
reflected by the Global Climate Coalition, but from the outset the conservative movement was heavily
involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2000</xref>).
The formation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 and the emergence of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from the UN&#x02019;s 1992 &#x0201c;Earth Summit&#x0201d; in Rio
generated fears of international action to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels use, fears
crystallized by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Consequently, corporate America (especially fossil fuels
corporations worried about restrictions on their products) and the U.S. conservative movement (for
which opposition to governmental regulations is foundational) joined forces in attacking the
scientific evidence for AGW and thus the necessity of reducing carbon emissions&#x02014;the goal of the
Kyoto Protocol.</p><p>Both industry and the conservative movement learned during the Reagan administration that frontal
attacks on environmental regulations could create a backlash among the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764213477096">Dunlap, 1987</xref>). Consequently, they gradually shifted to another
strategy, promoting &#x0201c;environmental skepticism.&#x0201d; This strategy challenges the scientific evidence for
environmental problems and therefore the need for regulations to protect environmental quality
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764213477096">Jacques, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213477096">Jacques, Dunlap, &#x00026; Freeman, 2008</xref>). Their major tactic was
and continues to be manufacturing uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764213477096">Michaels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213477096">Oreskes &#x00026; Conway,
2010</xref>), constantly asserting that the evidence is not sufficient to warrant regulatory action.
Historically these efforts focused on specific problems such as secondhand smoke, acid rain, and
ozone depletion, but in the case of AGW they have ballooned into a full-scale assault on the
multifaceted field of climate science, the IPCC, scientific organizations endorsing AGW, and even
individual scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213477096">Powell, 2011</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213477096">Weart, 2011</xref>).</p><p>With scientific evidence for AGW growing stronger and public awareness of global warming mounting
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764213477096">Nisbet &#x00026; Meyers, 2007</xref>), in the late
1990s portions of corporate America&#x02014;including some fossil fuels corporations&#x02014;expressed acceptance
both of the reality of AGW and necessity of reducing carbon emissions. Several corporations withdrew
from the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), gradually leading to its demise in 2002, and it appeared
that industry-funded attacks on the scientific evidence supporting AGW were subsiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213477096">Dunlap &#x00026; McCright, 2011</xref>). However, the
conservative movement seemed dismayed by the corporate &#x0201c;sellout&#x0201d; and stepped up its already
substantial efforts to deny the reality of climate change by attacking climate science and
scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2000</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764213477096">2003</xref>). This transition is symbolized by
the Cooler Heads Coalition, a coalition largely of conservative think tanks (CTTs) centered in the
Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), emerging to fill the void created by the GCC. Similarly, the
Heartland Institute, a small regional think tank in the 1990s, emerged as a leading force in climate
change denial in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764213477096">Pooley,
2010</xref>).</p><p>It now appears that CTTs such as CEI, the Heartland Institute, the CATO Institute, and the
Marshall Institute are playing an ever more important role in efforts to deny AGW by attacking
climate science. However, it must be noted that besides helping fund these think tanks, many
corporations maintain ambivalent positions concerning the necessity of reducing carbon emissions
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764213477096">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012</xref>).
Furthermore, major corporate associations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American
Petroleum Institute continue to strongly oppose policies to reduce carbon emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764213477096">Pooley, 2010</xref>). Still, although corporations can
bring their enormous resources to bear in lobbying against legislation, the conservative movement
(especially its think tanks) often takes the lead in manufacturing uncertainty over climate science.
Indeed, CTTs offer the ideal vehicle for undermining the credibility of climate science and
attacking climate scientists.</p><p>CTTs have long been recognized as the crucial organizational base of the conservative movement,
functioning as core &#x0201c;social movement organizations&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213477096">Jacques et al., 2008</xref>). Typically treated by media as credible
sources of objective information, CTTs have achieved the status of an &#x0201c;alternate academia,&#x0201d; and it
is common to see their representatives interviewed along with or in lieu of leading academics and
treated as independent experts on policy-relevant issues. They employ both in-house and commissioned
personnel to produce a vast array of print material (from op-eds to policy briefs to magazine
articles to books) as well as make media appearances, provide congressional testimony, give
speeches, and so on to promote conservative positions on a wide range of policy issues including
environmental protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap,
2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764213477096">2003</xref>). CTTs have been
credited with having a major impact on U.S. politics and policy making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764213477096">Stefanic &#x00026; Delgado, 1996</xref>), influencing such aspects of
American life as the conservative tilt of our judicial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764213477096">Teles, 2007</xref>), tax policies resulting in escalating inequality
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764213477096">Hacker &#x00026; Pierson, 2007</xref>), and the
fundamental framing of political debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764213477096">Smith,
2007</xref>).</p><p>It is little wonder then that CTTs have become central actors in climate change policy debates,
especially by promoting denial of the reality and significance of AGW and thus the necessity of
carbon emission reductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213477096">Dunlap &#x00026;

2011</xref>). The purpose of this article is to examine in detail one key tool CTTs use to sow
skepticism toward AGW throughout the larger society: sponsoring books espousing climate change
denial, including those by the small number of contrarian scientists who challenge mainstream
climate science.</p><sec id="section1-0002764213477096"><title>Books Challenging Climate Science</title><p>Although just one of many forms of media employed by CTTs, books are especially important for
reaching the conservative movement&#x02019;s core constituency, wider segments of the public, and critical
sectors of society such as corporate, political, and media leaders. Books confer a sense of
legitimacy on their authors and provide them an effective tool for combating the findings of climate
scientists that are published primarily in scholarly, peer-reviewed journals&#x02014;at least within the
public and policy (as opposed to scientific) arenas. Authors of successful books critiquing climate
science often come to be viewed as &#x0201c;climate experts,&#x0201d; regardless of their academic backgrounds or
scientific credentials, and despite the fact that their books are seldom peer reviewed. They are
interviewed on TV and radio, quoted by newspaper columnists, and cited by sympathetic politicians
and corporate figures. Their books are frequently carried by major bookstore chains, where they are
seen (even if not purchased) by a wide segment of the public, many receive enormous publicity on CTT
websites and from conservative and skeptical bloggers, and some are carried by the Conservative Book
Club. In short, books are a potent means for diffusing skepticism concerning AGW and the need to
reduce carbon emissions. Given the critical role of CTTs in challenging climate science and policy
making, and their proclivity for using books to promote their causes, we expect to find a strong
link between CTTs and books espousing climate change denial.</p><p>In part this expectation is based on prior experience. In an earlier study of environmental
skepticism writ large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213477096">Jacques et al.,
2008</xref>), we examined 141 books espousing skepticism toward the scientific evidence for
environmental problems of all types (including global warming) published through 2005, looking for
evidence of linkages to CTTs. We found that 130, or 92%, of the books were linked to a CTT, either
via publication by a CTT press or a verifiable connection between the author or editor and a CTT, or
both. These links to highly influential and generally well-heeled CTTs challenge a common theme of
the books&#x02014;namely, that the authors or editors are little Davids battling the Goliath of
environmental science.</p><p>The present study extends our earlier work by examining books espousing climate change denial per
se published through 2010, including some examined in the prior study since they represent examples
of environmental skepticism. Besides focusing on book connections to CTTs, we also examine the
educational credentials and national backgrounds of their authors or editors. Given that climate
change denial has become widespread within the United States and to some degree internationally, we
pay particular attention to the role of CTTs in diffusing a skeptical view of climate change and
climate science to a wider audience both within the United States and internationally.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0002764213477096"><title>The Study</title><p>Our data set consists of the population of English-language books assigned an International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) that espouse various forms of climate change denial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764213477096">1</xref></sup> These books reject evidence that global
warming is occurring, that human actions are the predominant cause of global warming, and/or that
global warming will have negative impacts on human and natural systems. These arguments have been
labeled trend, attribution, and impact denial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764213477096">Rahmstorf, 2004</xref>). Books were included only if they take one or more of these positions
challenging climate science, all of which are used to reject the necessity of carbon emission
reductions. We located 108 books espousing one or more of these versions of climate change denial
published through 2010, employing searches via online book stores, bibliographies in denial books,
references in articles written by climate change skeptics, and several skeptic blogs that promote
denial literature. Climate change denial books, especially those that were published by obscure
presses or were self-published, can be difficult to locate, and we have possibly missed a few.
However, we are confident that the 108 we analyze represent virtually all denial books in English,
allowing us to generalize our findings with confidence.</p><p>We limit our analysis to first-edition books, ignoring the small number of second-edition volumes
that came out in only slightly revised form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764213477096">2</xref></sup> The books are listed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0002764213477096">appendix</xref> (along with selected information we will shortly describe), grouped by their
country of origin as determined via the lead author&#x02019;s or editor&#x02019;s apparent place of residence, and
then arranged alphabetically by lead author or editor.</p><p>In addition to examining book links with CTTs&#x02014;as done in our prior study&#x02014;and location of lead
author, we coded date of publication, the type of publisher employed, and information on the
academic credentials (degrees and fields of study) of authors or editors. Our overall goal is to
provide a good sense of the sources of these volumes&#x02014;who is writing them and who is publishing
them&#x02014;paying special attention to the role of CTTs in the process. In the following sections we
describe our coding decisions and thereby clarify information presented for each book in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0002764213477096">appendix</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section3-0002764213477096"><title>Results</title><p>We begin by charting the publication of these books over time, documenting the recent rapid
increase in their numbers, and then highlight a significant new development&#x02014;the growth of
self-published books, often by laypersons denying AGW. We then examine the connections between CTTs
and the books, noting how this connection differs for books issued by publishing houses and those
that are self-published. We next examine the national origins of the books, showing how production
of climate change denial volumes has spread from the United States to several other nations as
denial has diffused internationally, noting the role of CTTs in this process. Then we turn to the
academic and scientific credentials of the authors or editors of the books, highlighting trends over
time and variation across nations. We end by commenting on how the publishing sources used by the
denial authors enables most of them to avoid peer review.</p><sec id="section4-0002764213477096"><title>Trends Over Time</title><p>As apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764213477096">Figure 1</xref>, the first denial
volume, Sherwood Idso&#x02019;s <italic>Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764213477096">3</xref></sup> appeared in 1982, well before AGW had achieved a prominent
place on the nation&#x02019;s agenda. Highlighting the benefits of carbon dioxide, Idso took issue with
early climate science that suggested increasing levels of carbon dioxide could produce deleterious
effects. The remaining 107 books began appearing in 1989, the year after AGW became a highly visible
issue in the United States and the IPCC was established, with 4 coming out that year. They were
followed by 19 denial books published in the 1990s, 13 of them in the last half of that decade,
reflecting a relatively slow but steady growth in their rate of publication. Another 15 appeared
during the first half of the next decade, followed by a veritable explosion of 54 in the second half
(especially 2007 to 2009), making a total of 69 from 2000 to 2009. Another 15 came out in 2010,
yielding the total of 108 we are examining.</p><fig id="fig1-0002764213477096" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Climate change denial books by year.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0002764213477096-fig1"/></fig><p>Many factors influence the writing and timing of books, and we can only speculate on the trend we
have just described. There is a slow growth in the number of books appearing before the December
1997 meeting on the Kyoto Protocol,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764213477096">4</xref></sup> then a relatively stable period of modest production (from one to five books a year)
for the following decade, followed by the very rapid increase in the number of denial books per year
beginning in 2007. There are several factors that likely stimulated the accelerated production of
denial books starting in 2007: The release of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213477096">Al
Gore&#x02019;s (2006)</xref>
<italic>An Inconvenient Truth</italic> in both video and book form the prior year and the enormous
publicity it received, culminating in the video receiving the 2007 Academy Award for best
documentary; Gore and the IPCC receiving the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize; publication of the IPCC&#x02019;s
fourth Assessment Report claiming &#x0201c;unequivocal&#x0201d; evidence of global warming, and attributing it
primarily to increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations; consideration of climate change
legislation in Congress, particularly the Warner-Lieberman Bill in the Senate and then the
Waxman-Markey Bill in the House; and a notable rise in public concern about global warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764213477096">Brulle, Carmichael, &#x00026; Jenkins, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The rising salience of global warming in the eyes of the public and the growing pressure for
ameliorative policy action stimulated those skeptical of AGW and opposed to carbon emission
reduction policies to step up their efforts to deny the reality and seriousness of AGW. One
manifestation of this increased sense of urgency is the accelerating appearance of books critiquing
climate science, attacking Gore and climate scientists, and arguing against the need for carbon
emission reductions. Other manifestations include conservative elites and media becoming major
vehicles for climate change denial, making it a virtual litmus test for Republican political
candidates and adding it to the &#x0201c;culture wars&#x0201d; (joining God, gays, guns, and abortion) in the eyes
of conservative laypeople&#x02014;particularly those attracted to the Tea Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764213477096">Hoffman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764213477096">Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, &#x00026; Hmielowski, 2011</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Such diffusion of climate change denial from the core sectors of the conservative movement,
especially think tanks, is reflected in an interesting development concerning the denial books: a
rapid growth in self-published volumes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764213477096">5</xref></sup> Specifically, 33 of the books under examination were published by individuals on
their own or via a &#x0201c;vanity press,&#x0201d; but 30 of them have appeared since 2000&#x02014;with 26 coming out
between 2007 and 2010! This development has influenced the relationship between denial books and
CTTs, as we see next.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0002764213477096"><title>Book Ties With Conservative Think Tanks</title><p>Our examination of the links between the denial books and CTTs follows the procedure we used in
our prior study of environmental skepticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213477096">Jacques et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, links were established in one of two ways: The author
or editor was affiliated with a CTT or the book was published (or copublished) by a CTT press (often
both). Author or editor affiliations with CTTs had to be empirically verifiable (typically from the
CTT websites, where they were listed as board members, advisors, experts, etc.) and were not
inferred. In choosing to err on the side of caution, we have possibly missed a few affiliations.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764213477096">Table 1</xref> shows the number of denial
books linked to CTTs by decade (2000&#x02013;2010 covers 11 years), as well by whether or not they were
issued by a publisher or were self-published. To begin with, in the bottom of the third column we
see that across all years 78 of the total 108 volumes, or 72%, have a verifiable link with a CTT.
Although reflecting a strong link between CTTs and the denial volumes, this is noticeably lower than
the 92% of books espousing environmental skepticism (which, again, includes some of the same books)
published through 2005 found to have such a link in our prior study. However, the primary reasons
for the lower percentage of climate change denial books being linked to CTTs are suggested by the
trends over time as well as a comparison of the links for self-published books versus those issued
by publishing houses. First, in the third column we can see that 100% of the denial books published
in the 1980s and 95% published in the 1990s are linked to CTTs, whereas this is true of &#x0201c;only&#x0201d; 65%
of those published since 2000. Second, the large decline in the percentage of CTT links since 2000
is primarily the result of the preponderance of self-published books appearing over the 11 years, as
only one third of the 30 self-published books coming out since 2000 are linked to a CTT. In
contrast, 83% of the books from publishing houses since 2000 have links to CTTs. More generally, in

segment of the conservative movement, just as endorsement of climate change denial has spread
throughout most of the conservative sector of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2011</xref>). Although the link between denial
books issued by publishing houses and CTT presses (87%) is nearly as strong as the overall link
found in our prior study of books espousing environmental skepticism, the link is much weaker for
self-published denial books. This reflects the fact that many of the self-published books are
written by laypeople, often without any scientific background whatsoever, who are clearly quite
conservative and have presumably adopted climate change denial because it has become a core tenet of
conservatism and is promoted by conservative media and elites.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that nearly all of the authors or editors of the 108 books
endorse a conservative ideology, confirming the strong link between conservatism and promotion of
climate change denial emphasized by analysts of the denial campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213477096">Dunlap &#x00026; McCright, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213477096">Oreskes &#x00026; Conway, 2010</xref>). Also, 17 of the 75 books issued by
a publishing house, including the numerous CTT presses, are published by overtly conservative
presses or conservative religious presses (as noted in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0002764213477096">appendix</xref>), additional evidence of the strong link between
conservatism and climate change denial.</p><p>Social movement organizations attempt to diffuse their views, both within the movement as well as
throughout the larger society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764213477096">Strang &#x00026;
Soule, 1998</xref>). As the core organizations of the conservative movement, CTTs have obviously
been effective in spreading climate change denial throughout the movement, helped of course by
conservative media and politicians, various Astroturf campaigns (that they helped establish), the
Tea Party, and other elements of what has been termed the climate change &#x0201c;denial machine&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213477096">Dunlap &#x00026; McCright, 2011</xref>). As noted above,
one manifestation is the increasing number of self-published books by conservative individuals not
directly linked to a CTT. The fact that these authors typically cite (and often rely heavily on)
prior books with links to CTTs illustrates this successful diffusion.</p><p>There should be no doubt as to which set of books is most influential. At major bookstores you
are likely to find titles like <italic>Red Hot Lies</italic> by Christopher Horner of the CEI,
<italic>Shattered Consensus</italic> by Patrick Michaels of the CATO Institute, or
<italic>Unstoppable Global Warming</italic> by Fred Singer of the Science and Environmental Policy
Project and Dennis Avery of the Hudson Institute, titles also likely to be carried by the
Conservative Book Club. On average, the books affiliated with CTTs receive far more publicity
(including media appearances for their authors), sell much better, and thus reach larger audiences
than do those that are self-published. In addition, individuals affiliated with CTTs are especially
likely to produce multiple denial volumes&#x02014;most notably Fred Singer with six and Patrick Michaels
with five. In fact, of the 15 individuals who have published two or more books, 14 are affiliated
with CTTs.</p><p>It is therefore clear that CTTs have played a central role in the explosion of books promoting
climate change denial. Indeed, the CTTs that have played particularly prominent roles in attacking
climate science in various ways are especially likely to publish (or copublish) the denial books,
with the Cato Institute publishing five, the Heartland Institute publishing four, and the CEI, the
Marshall Institute, the Hoover Institution, and the U.K. Institute for Economic Affairs each
publishing three. These same CTTs are of course linked to far more of the titles via author or
editor affiliations.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0002764213477096"><title>National Origins of Books</title><p>The denial of climate change has also diffused geographically, as in the past several years
vigorous denial campaigns have developed in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764213477096">Hamilton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764213477096">Hoggan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764213477096">Monbiot, 2007</xref>), and&#x02014;to a lesser degree&#x02014;in a number of other
nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213477096">Dunlap &#x00026; McCright, 2011</xref>).
This diffusion has been stimulated in part by the direct efforts of U.S.-based CTTs, which have sent
representatives including contrarian scientists Fred Singer and Patrick Michaels to other nations to
promote climate change denial and to network with other members of the denial community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764213477096">6</xref></sup> These efforts have succeeded particularly
well in nations that have a recent history of staunch conservative governments, influential CTTs,
and a strong fossil fuels sector&#x02014;as do Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, along with the
United States.</p><p>The results of the successful geographical diffusion of climate change denial are apparent in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764213477096">Table 2</xref> and the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0002764213477096">appendix</xref>. The latter shows that 19 of the denial books have been
authored (or in one case edited) by individuals residing in the United Kingdom, followed by 7 from
Canada and 6 from Australia. Other nations from which these English-only books have sprung include
Denmark, France, and Sweden, with two each, and the Czech Republic, Germany, New Zealand, and the
Netherlands, with one each.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002764213477096">7</xref></sup> The
results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764213477096">Table 2</xref> portray the pattern
of diffusion by decade. In the 1980s, 80% of the denial books originated in the United States, and
the United Kingdom was the only other nation with a single volume (contributing 20% of the small
total of five). In the 1990s, the United States contributed 63% of the denial books, followed by the
United Kingdom with 21%, whereas the other nine nations contributed 16%. Since 2000, 60% of the
denial books have come from the United States, 17% from the United Kingdom, and 24% from the
remaining nine nations. That 4 of every 10 denial books since 2000 have been produced by authors or
editors outside of the United States is evidence of the success of the U.S. conservative movement in
helping diffuse denial internationally.</p><table-wrap id="table2-0002764213477096" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Climate Change Denial Books by Nation by Decade and for All Years.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">United States<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">United Kingdom<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Other<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Total<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1980s</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">80</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1990s</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">63</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2000+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">24</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">101<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn1-0002764213477096">a</xref></sup></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">84</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">All years</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">61</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">66</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">108</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-0002764213477096"><label>a.</label><p>Rounding error.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The role of CTTs in diffusing climate change denial internationally is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764213477096">Table 3</xref>.

79% of the books from the United Kingdom are connected to CTTs, and 87% of the books from the
various other nations are connected to CTTs. Thus, the pattern of strong connections between climate
change denial books coming out of other nations (the large majority of which were published since
2000) comes close to the earlier situation in the United States where all 4 of the denial books
published in the 1980s are linked to CTTs, and 11 of 12 published in the 1990s have such a link,

in science&#x02014;likely to be accepted as &#x0201c;experts&#x0201d; by the public, media, and policy makers&#x02014;to attack
scientific evidence suggesting the need for environmental regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213477096">Jacques et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764213477096">Michaels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213477096">Oreskes &#x00026; Conway, 2010</xref>). In their efforts to manufacture
uncertainty over climate science, both the fossil fuels industry (especially early on) and CTTs have
enlisted the support of a small number of contrarian scientists to critique and attack both climate
science and climate scientists. Although the contrarians portray themselves as a minority of truth

produce a wide range of material, from op-eds to policy briefs to an occasional journal article) to
the denial volumes, as well as the backgrounds of the nonscientists who are also producing them. We
coded each author or editor in terms of his or her highest academic degree and the field in which it
was obtained. For present purposes we have separated the authors or editors into three categories:
(a) those with PhDs in natural science (regardless of the field, thus including chemistry, geology,
soil science, etc., as well as those more directly related to climate science), (b) those with other
PhDs or equivalent degrees,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002764213477096">8</xref></sup> often
in social science, and (c) those with less than a doctorate. Of the of 106 individuals who have
authored or coauthored or edited or coedited one or more of the 108 denial books, 32 have a natural
science PhD, 24 have a PhD in other fields, and 50 do not have doctorates.</p><p>We next assigned a code to each volume based on the highest or most relevant degree of

contributors well beyond the small number of contrarian (natural) scientists in its ranks. Again,
however, we can observe some degree of diffusion over time, as individuals with natural science
doctorates were involved in producing 80% of the small number of books coming out in the 1980s (4 of
5) and 53% (10 of 19) in the 1990s, but only 33% (28 of 84) since 2000. Thus, the campaign to deny
the significance of AGW relied heavily on contrarian scientists early on, to give it scientific
credibility, but over time climate change denial has spread sufficiently throughout the conservative
community that individuals without any scientific expertise now produce denial volumes.</p><p>Finally, just as we earlier noted variation in the degree to which denial books are linked to
CTTs across nations, we also find national variation in the reliance on contrarian scientists. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002764213477096">Table 5</xref> shows that natural scientists are
involved with nearly half (48%) of the denial volumes coming from the United States. In stark
contrast, only 2 of the 19 denial books or just 11% coming out of the United Kingdom have natural
scientists as authors or editors, whereas 35% of the denial books from the remaining nine countries
are produced (or coproduced) by natural scientists. These patterns partially reflect temporal
trends, since the natural scientists are most heavily involved in the denial books published before
2000, and the preponderance of non-U.S. books have come out since then.</p><table-wrap id="table5-0002764213477096" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Climate Change Denial Books by Author or Editor Degrees by Nation and for All Books.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Natural science PhD<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Other PhD<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">No PhD<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Total books<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">%</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">United States</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">48</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">32</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">33</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">22</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">99<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn3-0002764213477096">a</xref></sup></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">66</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">United Kingdom</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">32</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">58</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">101<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn3-0002764213477096">a</xref></sup></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Other</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">35</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">52</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">All books</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">39</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">42</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">42</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">45</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">108</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn3-0002764213477096"><label>a.</label><p>Rounding error.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>What these patterns suggest is that early on a small number of contrarian scientists, primarily
located in the United States, played a critical role in planting and legitimating climate change
denial within conservative circles. Highly influential scientists such as physicists Frederick
Seitz, Robert Jastrow, and Robert Nierenberg of the Marshall Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764213477096">Lahsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213477096">Oreskes &#x00026; Conway, 2010</xref>) and omnipresent Fred Singer and
Patrick Michaels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764213477096">Hoggan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213477096">Powell, 2011</xref>) worked diligently to criticize
climate science and scientists and received a good deal of visibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2003</xref>). As denial evolved over time and
spread throughout a larger segment of American society (particularly among conservatives) as well as
to other nations, the seeds sown by the contrarians have germinated and a wide range of individuals
without backgrounds in natural science and thus relevant credentials for evaluating climate science
feel free to write books denying AGW&#x02014;and often publish them on their own! Of course, the diffusion
has been facilitated by powerful actors, first by the fossil fuels industry and then by the
conservative movement, primarily via the latter&#x02019;s influential think tanks.</p><p>The strong connection between contrarian scientists and CTTs is reflected in one additional
finding. Of the 32 individuals with natural science PhDs in our study, 25 or 78% are connected to at
least one CTT. In contrast, of the 50 individuals without a PhD, only 25 or 50% have a CTT
connection, reflecting the fact that these people are often laypersons who are likely to
self-publish their books. The strongest connection exists for the 24 individuals with nonscience
PhDs, as 21 or 88% of them have links to one or more CTTs, where degrees in economics (8
individuals), politics (4 individuals), and law (3 individuals) confer plausible policy
expertise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section8-0002764213477096"><title>Freedom From Peer Review and Its Implications</title><p>It is often noted that individuals promoting climate change denial, including the small number of
contrarian scientists, mainly criticize or &#x0201c;audit&#x0201d; the work of climate scientists (especially as
summarized by the IPCC), and only infrequently contribute to climate science themselves (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213477096">Powell, 2011</xref>, chap. 3). Unlike mainstream
climate scientists, who publish primarily in peer-reviewed journals, these critics typically employ
a range of non-peer-reviewed outlets, ranging from blogs to the books we are examining. A large
majority&#x02014;97 of the 108 books&#x02014;are self-published (33), published by a CTT press (35), published by a
conservative (or conservative religious) press (17), or published by a popular press (12), and are
thus unlikely to have undergone peer review&#x02014;particularly by individuals with expertise in climate
science. The remaining 11 books are issued by publishing houses that specialize in natural science
and may have been subject to peer review, but this is often not clear from the publishers&#x02019; websites.
Of interest, four volumes are issued by Multi-Science Publishing in the United Kingdom, which also
publishes <italic>Energy &#x00026; Environment</italic>, a minor journal known primarily for providing a
forum for climate skeptics and criticized for lack of adequate peer review (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764213477096">Barley, 2011</xref>). Notably, not a single denial book
is published by a university press.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0002764213477096">10</xref></sup></p><p>The general lack of peer review allows authors or editors of denial books to make inaccurate
assertions that misrepresent the current state of climate science. Like the vast range of other
non-peer-reviewed material produced by the denial community, book authors can make whatever claims
they wish, no matter how scientifically unfounded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0002764213477096">11</xref></sup> In fact, the lack of peer review in the &#x0201c;denialosphere&#x0201d;
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764213477096">Pooley, 2010</xref>) means that denial claims
are continually recycled, no matter how many times they are refuted by empirical test or shown to be
logically untenable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213477096">Powell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764213477096">Washington &#x00026; Cook, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213477096">Weart (2011</xref>, p. 48) terms them &#x0201c;zombie
arguments&#x0201d; because they repeatedly rise from the grave.</p><p>Whereas scientific knowledge slowly but surely accumulates through testing, and then rejecting,
modifying, and/or verifying hypotheses and theories,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0002764213477096">12</xref></sup> the denial literature is cumulative in the literal
sense. Regardless of how thoroughly discredited in the scientific literature, denialist claims (the
recent warming trend reflects a natural cycle, is the result of solar activity, won&#x02019;t produce
harmful impacts, etc.) are retained and reused whenever convenient. Non-peer-reviewed books
espousing climate change denial offer an ideal means of presenting these claims, accounting for the
growing popularity of such books. Strikingly, many of these books not only provide fallacious
critiques of climate science but also present an alternate reality in which global warming is a hoax
created by a conspiracy of supposedly greedy scientists, liberal politicians, and environmentalists
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764213477096">McKewon, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The general lack of peer review for the denial books is a common feature of the vast body of
literature produced by the climate change denial community, ranging from blogs to newspaper op-eds
to policy briefs from CTTs. Not being subject to peer review allows authors or editors of denial
books to make scientifically inaccurate and discredited claims that are often amplified in
conservative media and the blogosphere, potentially reaching significant segments of the general
public. Their false claims are also used by conservative politicians, who sometimes invite the
authors to testify at congressional hearings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764213477096">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2003</xref>) and thereby provide them a direct voice in the policy-making
arena. Although mainstream scientists occasionally take the time to debunk some of the more visible
denial volumes, the proliferation of such books makes it impossible for busy scientists to
critically review most of them. Thus, denial books are likely to continue to multiply, and many will
receive considerable attention from sympathetic and scientifically unsophisticated audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764213477096">McKewon, 2012</xref>). They are clearly a vital weapon
in the conservative movement&#x02019;s war on climate science, and one of the key means by which it diffuses
climate change denial throughout American society and into other nations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks are due to Robert Brulle and Aaron McCright for valuable comments on earlier drafts.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,
