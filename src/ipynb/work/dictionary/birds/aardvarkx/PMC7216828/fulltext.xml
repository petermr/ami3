Pathogenic variants in at least 33 genes cause syndromic or non&#x02010;syndromic AI. Recently variants in <italic>RELT</italic>, encoding an orphan receptor in the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, were found to cause recessive AI, as part of a syndrome encompassing small stature and severe childhood infections. Here we describe four additional families with autosomal recessive hypomineralised AI due to previously unreported homozygous mutations in <italic>RELT</italic>. Three families carried a homozygous missense variant in the fourth exon (c.164C&#x0003e;T, p.(T55I)) and a fourth family carried a homozygous missense variant in the 11th exon (c.1264C&#x0003e;T, p.(R422W)). We found no evidence of additional syndromic symptoms in affected individuals. Analyses of tooth microstructure with computerised tomography and scanning electron microscopy suggest a role for RELT in ameloblasts' coordination and interaction with the enamel matrix. Microsatellite genotyping in families segregating the T55I variant reveals a shared founder haplotype. These findings extend the <italic>RELT</italic> pathogenic variant spectrum, reveal a founder mutation in the UK Pakistani population and provide detailed analysis of human teeth affected by this hypomineralised phenotype, but do not support a possible syndromic presentation in all those with <italic>RELT</italic>&#x02010;variant associated AI.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

It is characterised by three stages.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> During the initial secretory phase, a protein&#x02010;rich extracellular matrix (ECM) is secreted in a highly organised fashion by a monolayer of specialised cells known as ameloblasts that retreat away from a pre&#x02010;formed dentine surface. There is then a transition phase when the immature enamel reaches its final thickness, ECM secretion stops, and ECM proteins begin to be degraded in a controlled way. This is followed by a maturation stage during which ameloblasts pump mineral ions into the ECM, forming hydroxyapatite crystals which are organised in an intricate decussating pattern to make up the enamel prisms (rods), while the ECM proteins continue to be removed to make room for crystal growth.</p><p>Defects in proteins involved in any of these stages and processes can cause amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). AI is the common endpoint for an assortment of heterogeneous genetic enamel defects, presenting with an isolated or syndromic phenotype and typically inherited as X&#x02010;linked, dominant or recessive conditions. Thus far, variants in 19 genes have been implicated in non&#x02010;syndromic AI.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> A further 19 genes are listed in OMIM as being associated with syndromic forms of AI, with 5 implicated in both non&#x02010;syndromic and syndromic disease. Prevalence varies between populations, with frequency estimates of between 1 in 14000<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and 1 in 700.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> AI has an adverse impact on affected individuals often starting in early childhood, with poor aesthetics and functional failure. Discoloured, weak enamel can quickly break down causing pain, infection and early tooth loss with subsequent malocclusion. This in turn leads to high levels of distress, social avoidance, discomfort, isolation and emotional problems.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>
</p><p>Recently Kim and co&#x02010;workers reported one missense and two nonsense variants in the gene encoding Receptor Expressed in Lymphoid Tissues (<italic>RELT</italic>, OMIM: 611211), causing hypoplastic AI.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Affected individuals were also of short stature and their medical history suggested increased susceptibility to childhood infection, potentially implying a syndromic form of AI.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p><p>By homology, the 430&#x02010;amino acid RELT protein appears to be a receptor in the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, which comprises 19 ligands (TNFs) and 29 receptors (TNFRs).<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> It consists of an extracellular region with two cysteine&#x02010;rich domains homologous to other TNFR superfamily members and a predicted N&#x02010;glycosylation site, a central transmembrane domain and a unique intracellular domain.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> However, RELT is an orphan TNFR which does not appear to bind to any of the 19 known TNF ligands.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>
</p><p>RELT has been shown to be abundant in haematopoietic tissues, where it is involved in the activation of the NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B pathway, inducing cell apoptosis by binding with TRAF1 (TNF receptor&#x02010;associated factor 1).<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Interestingly, RELT is unique among the TNFRs, as it does not have the characteristic death domain found in the intracellular region of the other TNFRs and, additionally, it only binds to TRAF1 and none of the other TRAF molecules, suggesting a non&#x02010;canonical TNFR pathway of apoptosis.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> It was also reported that the function of RELT might be dependent on the co&#x02010;expression of its two homologues RELL1 and RELL2 (RELT&#x02010;like 1 and 2), which are shown to induce apoptosis in the absence of trimeric TNF ligands.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> More recently, RELT, along with RELL1 and RELL2, were shown to activate p38 MAPK induced apoptosis when overexpressed.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>
</p><p>Prior to the study by Kim and colleagues, no connection had been made between RELT and any pathogenic phenotype in human or mouse models. Their study implicates RELT in the secretory stage of amelogenesis. Here we report two additional novel missense variants in the <italic>RELT</italic> gene that cause autosomal recessive hypomineralised AI in four families, confirming that mutations in <italic>RELT</italic> cause AI. Our findings extend the observed mutation spectrum, reveal a founder mutation common to three UK Pakistani families and provide detailed analysis of human teeth affected by this hypomineralised phenotype, but suggest that <italic>RELT</italic> variants are not always associated with a broader, syndromic phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="cge13721-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="cge13721-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Patient enrolment</title><p>Affected and unaffected individuals were recruited with informed consent and local ethical approval from families segregating recessively&#x02010;inherited AI, in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki with local ethical approval (REC 13/YH/0028).

These were part of a large cohort of AI families archived by the Leeds Dental Genetics Group. This cohort includes patients of various ethnicities with all three typical modes of inheritance, and over&#x02010;represents recessive disease due to high consanguinity in the local Pakistani population.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>
</p><p>Family 1 is a UK Pakistani family with the proband and one sibling presenting with hypomineralised AI (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A,E</xref>). Radiographs of unerupted permanent teeth show an apparently normal enamel volume with a difference in radiodensity between enamel and dentine, with loss of the normal crown contours after eruption (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>A). Teeth in the mouth have variable loss of enamel consistent with post&#x02010;eruptive changes characterised by irregular surface loss and associated discolouration that progressed over time. The other three siblings and both parents are unaffected and there is no family history of AI reported. The parents of the proband reported that they were thought to be distant relatives, suggesting potential consanguinity. The medical histories of the affected children lack any reference to recurrent infection during infancy and there are no other recognised co&#x02010;segregating clinical features.</p><p>WES analysis of the proband revealed a <italic>RELT</italic> missense variant that segregates with disease in all family members in an autosomal recessive manner. Affected individuals are homozygous for a variant in <italic>RELT</italic> exon 4: c.164C&#x0003e;T [Refseq: NM_032871.3], p.(T55I) [NP_116260.2]. This variant is not present in gnomAD or EVS and is predicted to be pathogenic by both MutationTaster2 (Disease causing, p: 0.951) and CADD v1.3 (score: 27.6).</p><p>Family 2 is a consanguineous UK family, also of Pakistani origin (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The proband, her two brothers, mother and maternal grandfather are all reported to be affected. The radiographic phenotype was consistent with family 1 with no clinical images available (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>B). No other potential syndromic features were apparent and there was no report of recurrent infections in infancy or childhood. WES analysis of the proband identified the same homozygous c.164C&#x0003e;T, p.(T55I) variant as in family 1.</p><p>Family 3 is also a consanguineous UK Pakistani family. The proband is the only one of three siblings diagnosed with AI, characterised by enamel surface irregularities and evidence of good enamel volumes on radiographs (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C,F</xref>; Figure <xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C). Again, no other potentially syndromic features were noted and there was no history of recurrent infection in infancy. However, the proband and both other siblings were also diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia (IVA; OMIM #243500), an autosomal recessive condition in which the body is unable to metabolise leucine. IVA is caused by variants in the gene encoding isovaleryl&#x02010;CoA dehydrogenase (<italic>IVD</italic>) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> without any recognised impact on enamel formation. A pathogenic <italic>IVD</italic> variant had previously been identified in this family as part of clinical care. WES analysis of the proband revealed the same variant in exon 4 of <italic>RELT</italic> as in families 1 and 2, c.164C&#x0003e;T, p.(T55I), as well as the <italic>IVD</italic> variant.</p><p>Family 4 is a non&#x02010;consanguineous Costa Rican family presenting with AI in three children characterised by irregular surface loss of enamel and dental radiographs that included good enamel volumes (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D, G</xref>; Figure <xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>D). The parents do not have the same phenotype, although the mother presents with minor enamel irregularities on the cusps of the molars and canines. There is no report of any extraoral phenotype or recurrent infections in the family medical history.</p><p>WES analysis in the proband of family 4 identified a homozygous <italic>RELT</italic> variant in exon 11: c.1264C&#x0003e;T, p.(R422W), which segregated with the AI phenotype. This variant is in dbSNP (rs139368769) and is also present in gnomAD with MAF: 0.001633 and in EVS with MAF: 0.00077.

This confirms the finding of Kim and colleagues that mutations in <italic>RELT</italic> cause an AI phenotype,<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> and extends the observed spectrum of pathogenic variants, bringing the total to five (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dna2.leeds.ac.uk">http://dna2.leeds.ac.uk</ext-link>/LOVD/genes/RELT). These include a variant in the splice acceptor site at the end of intron 3 which disrupts normal splicing, a 2 bp deletion and a frameshift variant in exon 10, as well as missense variants in exons 4 and 11. The fact that two of the three missense variants alter residue R422 could potentially imply some unique function in tooth formation for this site in the protein, which is disrupted by these variants. However, the high pathogenicity prediction scores for these variants and the presence of likely null mutations, together with a recessive pattern of inheritance, instead suggest a haploinsufficiency mechanism, with complete loss of RELT function in affected individuals. Additional reported mutations will further illuminate the likely disease mechanism underlying AI due to variants in <italic>RELT</italic>.</p><p>The four families presented have a shared enamel phenotype with normal or near&#x02010;normal enamel volume present prior to tooth eruption. Post&#x02010;eruptive changes are rapid and lead to enamel loss, particularly at sites subject to physical loading such as occlusal surfaces. This phenotype shares features with that reported for <italic>Relt</italic>
<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which have hypomineralised, full thickness enamel with a typical arrangement of enamel prisms.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Although the difference in degree of mineralisation in AI and control teeth analysed in this study was modest, the overall features are most consistent with a hypomineralised form of AI. This highlights that &#x0201c;hypomineralised AI&#x0201d; is poorly defined and that the term does not take account of any variations in how the hydroxyapatite mineral is organised to give the resistance to physical attrition that characterises normal enamel. The enamel phenotype described here contrasts with the more severe phenotype of diminished enamel matrix formation leading to hypoplastic AI reported previously for <italic>RELT</italic> variants.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Additionally, there is variable but mild taurodontism involving permanent molar teeth, identified in the lower right second molar of family 3 (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) and the second molar of family 4 (Figure <xref rid="cge13721-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>) and consistent with the radiographs for family 3 reported by Kim and colleagues.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> This radiographic feature is not as dramatic as that associated with AI due to <italic>DLX3</italic> genetic variants. The evaluation of future <italic>RELT</italic> cases will clarify whether taurodontism is a consistent feature and whether this has any implications for clinical care, as well as help to determine the spectrum of enamel phenotypes due to <italic>RELT</italic> variations.</p><p>Early enamel attrition after eruption is probably a consequence of abnormal enamel structure even though enamel prisms are present. The disorganised, non&#x02010;prismatic layers of enamel noted in Figure <xref rid="cge13721-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref> resemble closely the enamel architecture in AI patients carrying heterozygous <italic>LAMB3</italic> variants, as reported by Smith et al.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> AI&#x02010;causing variants in <italic>LAMB3</italic> and other hemidesmosomal proteins are thought to result in defective attachment of ameloblasts to the enamel matrix. Teeth from families with AI due to either <italic>LAMB3</italic> or <italic>RELT</italic> variants have layers of disorganised, non&#x02010;prismatic enamel lamellae and areas where enamel is prismatic but abnormal. These similarities of expression staging and phenotype could suggest a possible common mechanism for these different forms of AI. Of note is the recent report that ADAM10, a protein known to release anchored proteins, is expressed during the secretory phase of amelogenesis (but not thereafter) and that ADAM 10 cleaves the extracellular domain of RELT.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Lamellal structures were not present in murine <italic>Relt</italic>
<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> enamel, although there was an absence of the poorly mineralised spaces that would normally be expected at the dentino&#x02010;enamel junction.</p><p>Kim and colleagues reported that both heterozygous parents of family 1, carrying the c.1169_1170delCT variant, presented with a mild AI phenotype, consisting of subtle, localised enamel surface roughness and vertical enamel layers.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> This carrier phenotype was not noted in the other two families presented. Heterozygous members of the families reported in this study show no enamel abnormalities or malformations, with the exception of the mother (I:2) in family 4, who shows lesions on the cusps of her molars and canines. These could constitute a mild carrier phenotype in I:2, but these findings are absent from the father (I:1), who is also a heterozygous carrier of the same variant. Further studies are therefore required to confirm or exclude the existence of a mild carrier phenotype for AI due to <italic>RELT</italic> variants.</p><p>The protein structure of RELT has not been experimentally observed, and its function and the specific ligand that binds to it have not yet been characterised. We attempted to predict the tertiary structure of RELT using homology recognition. The homology of <italic>RELT</italic> to existing models only spans the TNFR region which accounts for 26% of the protein sequence (<xref rid="cge13721-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). Mutating the predicted structure shows a probable decrease in protein stability for all of the variants implicated in AI causation. However, given the limited homology to other available models, the <italic>ab initio</italic> prediction of the structure of the entire peptide should be interpreted with caution, as should the predicted effect that the pathogenic variants will have on protein structure.</p><p>The previous report on biallelic <italic>RELT</italic> variants causing AI included evidence suggestive of a syndromic phenotype, including short stature and recurrent infantile infections. Kim and colleagues noted conservation of the <italic>RELT</italic> sequence, even in species that have no teeth, suggesting that this provided further support for probably syndromic consequences. However, sequence conservation across species need not imply conserved function, since proteins can have multiple functions, functions can change through time or the primary function can become obsolete.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Thus, proteins with an enamel&#x02010;specific function might also have other roles in animals that have lost their teeth, such as pangolin (<italic>Manis javanica</italic>), platypus (<italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>) and the baleen whales, for example, minke whale (<italic>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</italic>), or that do not have enamel, such as aardvark (<italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>), two&#x02010;toed sloth (<italic>Choloepus hoffmanni</italic>) and other members of their families. For example, AMBN, another protein involved in the secretory stage of amelogenesis,<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> has been shown to participate in cell adhesion and proliferation,<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> and has roles in adipose cells<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> and in osteogenesis in mice.<xref rid="cge13721-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="cge13721-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Nevertheless, <italic>AMBN</italic> mutations appear to cause only non&#x02010;syndromic AI. Examination of patients from the four families recruited in this study and of their medical histories gave no indication of additional features. Our findings therefore do not support a clear syndromic phenotype for all <italic>RELT</italic> variants. As further cases are reported the extent of the syndromic phenotype should become clearer.</p><p>In conclusion, we confirm that biallelic variants in <italic>RELT</italic> cause hypomineralised AI characterised by normal or near normal enamel volumes, but leading to enamel that is prone to wear rapidly due to attrition. We find no evidence to support a clear syndromic element in the families reported here. This study extends the observed pathogenic variant spectrum and reveals a common founder mutation in UK Pakistani AI families. We also show how human enamel structure is affected, with regions of both layered enamel and enamel which retains some prismatic structure but is abnormally formed. We note similarities to the phenotype seen in teeth of patients carrying <italic>LAMB3</italic> variants, indicating a possible connection between the role of RELT in amelogenesis and attachment of the ameloblasts to the enamel matrix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="cge13721-sec-0013"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="cge13721-supitem-0001"><caption><p>
