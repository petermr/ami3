In animals, including humans, it is associated with important embryological and physiological signaling processes, such as Wnt and insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Cross <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Papkoff and Aikawa, 1998</xref>). As a consequence it is linked to major clinical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. At the cellular level GSK3 mediates processes, such as regulation of gene expression, control of proteolysis, metabolism, and control of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Harwood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The question of how GSK3 exerts its effects on these multiple processes is important for understanding the integration of cell signaling within the cellular context.</p><p>The social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> grows and divides in the presence of nutrients in a unicellular form, but when starved it undergoes a developmental program to form a multicellular and differentiated structure, termed the fruiting body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Harwood, 2001</xref>). <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development comprises of two major phases. First, during aggregation phase, cells migrate together by chemotaxis in a process mediated by cAMP pulses. Second, the multicellular aggregate, or mound, undertakes a series of differentiation events and morphogenetic movements to ultimately form a fruiting body, which comprises spore cells within a spherical head, supported by a stalk of vacuolated, cellulose encased stalk cells.</p><p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> possesses a single homologue of GSK3, <italic>gskA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Harwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). It was discovered previously that GskA regulates the processes that control cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Harwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). This initially occurs during early stages of multicellular development, when cells first come together to form a multicellular mound. At this point, cells differentiate into three basic cell types; prespore cells that eventually form spores, and prestalk cells (pst) comprising pstA cells that give rise to the stalk and the majority of its associated structures and pstB cells that form the basal disk that anchors the stalk to the substratum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). In wild-type cells, 80% of the cells form prespore cells and the remainder form pst cells, of which the majority are pstA. However, in a <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant, the pstB population expands at the expense of the prespore population, so that the final fruiting body of the basal disk is greatly enlarged and the spore head reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Harwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). During later stages of fruiting body formation, GskA regulates a second cell fate decision by controlling the differentiation from pstA cells to pstAB cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Schilde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), which progress to form the main structural element of the stalk.</p><p>In the mound, activation of GskA is mediated by high concentrations of cAMP via the cAMP receptors carC and carD, which control tyrosine phosphorylation of GskA by the kinase ZakA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and an unidentified tyrosine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Downstream of GskA lies a &#x003b2;-catenin homologue, Aardvark (Aar; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Grimson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factor, STATa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Ginger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), although the full role of these proteins is currently unclear.</p><p>Although the phenotypes described for <italic>gskA</italic> null mutants occur during multicellular stages, GskA expression and activity is present throughout <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Plyte <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). A proteomic and microarray analysis of cells at 5 h of development, several hours before the first multicellular developmental stages, revealed &#x02248;150 genes with altered patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Strmecki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Curiously, of those genes identified that had been characterized previously, all are associated with growth and aggregation phase rather than multicellular development. This raises the question of additional roles of GskA during these earlier stages of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development.</p><p>Here, we report an in-depth investigation of aggregation and chemotaxis of <italic>gskA</italic> null mutants. We find that <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells have defective chemotaxis toward cAMP and folate, a growth phase chemoattractant. The chemotaxis defect is accompanied by suppression of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) levels. However, we observe that loss of <italic>gskA</italic> causes a much greater effect on cAMP-mediated chemotaxis than can be accounted for by loss of PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hoeller and Kay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Takeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We find that protein kinase B (PKB)R1 is not phosphorylated in <italic>gskA</italic> mutants, a protein kinase related to PKB but regulated in a PIP<sub>3</sub>-independent manner. Loss of both PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling and PKBR1 phosphorylation has a strong effect on chemotaxis. Finally, we show that <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells do not generate cAMP pulses during aggregation, demonstrating that GskA plays a major role in the regulation of chemotaxis and early <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>The <italic>gskA</italic> null strain (ID Strain: DBS0236114) was obtained from the Dicty Stock Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/">http://dictybase.org/</ext-link>) and was originally generated in the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> strain AX2 background.

The earlier microarray was carried out in cells that had been starved for 5 h and matched the developmental state of those used in our chemotaxis experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Strmecki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We reexamined the results of the microarray but failed to detect differences in gene expression of the cAMP receptor genes. <italic>carA</italic> is the major receptor expressed during aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Sun and Devreotes, 1991</xref>), and we used qRT-PCR to confirm that there was no difference in <italic>carA</italic> gene expression between wild-type and <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The microarray showed altered expression of <italic>pdsA</italic> and <italic>pdiA</italic> genes, all which play a role in aggregation and we confirmed that induction of <italic>pdsA</italic>, which encodes a cAMP phosphodiesterase, is indeed substantially reduced in <italic>gskA</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Finally, a survey of major genes expressed during aggregation showed that the expression of the adenylyl cyclase <italic>acaA</italic> gene was induced to only 30% of the wild type. This may have been below the threshold to detect on the microarray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>To confirm that <italic>gskA</italic> null cells can sense and respond to cAMP, we examined the response of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) to cAMP stimulation. In wild-type cells, an accumulation of PTEN protein was seen on the cell membrane but was lost to the cytosol within seconds of cAMP accumulation. This relocalization was still present in <italic>gskA</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), demonstrating that the loss of <italic>gskA</italic> did not block cAMP sensing and some downstream events.</p><p>To examine chemotaxis in a context independent of cAMP signaling, we investigated the ability of the <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant to chemotax toward folate.

It therefore is a good monitor for PIP<sub>3</sub> synthesis after cAMP stimulation. In wild-type cells, PKBA phosphorylation occurred within seconds of cAMP stimulation, with a peak between 10 and 20 s, and then declined to basal levels by 60 s. No cAMP stimulated elevation of PKBA occurred in <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

In contrast, elevation of PIP<sub>3</sub> may bypass a block in an alternative pathway, such as activation of PI3-kinase. We measured synthesis of phosphatidyl inositol phosphates (PIPs) in wild-type, <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant, and <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant IMPA-overexpressing cells. We observed no difference in phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP), and PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis between wild-type and <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).

Previously, it has been found that signaling via the kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) acting in the TORC2 complex was capable of mediating cAMP chemotaxis when PIP<sub>3</sub> synthesis was inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kamimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This alternative chemotaxis mechanism acts via a second PKB homologue, known as PkgB, or PKBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Meili <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). This kinase protein is associated with the plasma membrane via myristoylation and not via a PH domain&#x02013;PIP<sub>3</sub> interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Meili <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and is activated by phosphorylation from TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We examined PKBR1 phosphorylation in <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells after cAMP stimulation, and found that as seen for PKBA, PKBR1 phosphorylation was also lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We could detect <italic>PKBR1</italic> expression (data not shown), suggesting a signaling failure upstream of PKBR1. In contrast to PKBA phosphorylation, PKBR1 phosphorylation was not restored by overexpression of IMPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), indicating that this second molecular mechanism is independent of PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling. These results indicated that GskA is required for two intracellular signaling processes, explaining why it possesses a very strong chemotaxis defect.</p></sec><sec><title>gskA Null Mutants Have Impaired cAMP Synthesis</title><p>Although it restored chemotaxis, IMPA overexpression did not rescue aggregation or any other aspect of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and Supplemental Movie 2).

To test whether these cells can generate cAMP signals, cells were developed for 5 h in suspension and stimulated with the cAMP analogue 2-deoxyadenosine 3,5-monophosphate (dcAMP), and cAMP synthesis was measured.

These observations suggested that although PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling is sufficient to rescue chemotaxis, it was unable to restore cAMP signaling and fully rescue aggregation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we report that loss of GskA has substantial effects on <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> aggregation, causing a major defect in chemotaxis and cAMP signaling. This phenotype correlates with the presence of GskA activity during early stages of development and the results of previous microarray and proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Plyte <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Strmecki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These results reveal an unexpectedly strong chemotaxis phenotype, which has been previously missed, and indicates that the terminal developmental phenotype of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> mutants may not be a good indicator of defective chemotaxis.</p><p>Loss of <italic>gskA</italic> has a substantial effect on chemotaxis toward both cAMP and folate. These two chemotactic responses are mediated by different receptors and G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kumagai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Hadwiger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Together with the expression of the cAMP receptor <italic>carA</italic> and the presence of the PTEN response, these observations argue that the requirement for GskA lies at the level of effector activation rather than with signal sensing. We do not know exactly how loss of GskA inhibits folate chemotaxis, and our further conclusions are based on our investigation of the better characterized cAMP chemotaxis response.</p><p>We found that loss of <italic>gskA</italic> caused a major decrease in PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling, which could be bypassed by elevation of PIP<sub>3</sub> after overexpression of IMPA. Previous observations have shown that PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling is able to elicit the chemotaxis response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Kortholt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), explaining how this restores chemotaxis to <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells. Although PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling is sufficient for chemotaxis, it is not essential and a simple loss of PIP<sub>3</sub> cannot totally explain the severe chemotaxis phenotype observed for the <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells. Loss or inhibition of PI3K or PIP<sub>3</sub> synthesis reduces speed and directionality in chemotaxing cells; however, it has only a minor effect on the CI value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hoeller and Kay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">King <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In contrast, although we also saw reduced speed and directionality in the <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant, we also measured a large drop in the CI value. We found that loss of <italic>gskA</italic> blocks phosphorylation of PKBR1, a PIP<sub>3</sub>-independent component of a parallel signaling pathway that also mediates chemotaxis to cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kolsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We conclude that GskA acts upstream of both PIP<sub>3</sub>- and PKBR1-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism of GskA action on both PIP<sub>3</sub> and PKBR1. Phosphorylation of PKBA probably relies on both the action of TORC2 and another kinase, most likely PDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kamimura and Devreotes 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Liao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), whereas GskA also acts upstream of TORC2, hence affecting subsequent phosphorylation of PKBR1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmk0151095290006"/></fig><p>In our experiments, we monitored PKBA and PKBR1 activation through antibodies specific to motifs phosphorylated by the protein kinase PDK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kamimura and Devreotes, 2010</xref>). This in turn is dependent on phosphorylation by TOR kinase as part of the TORC2 complex after cAMP stimulation. These events occur at the plasma membrane so that PKBR1 is dependent solely on TORC2 activation, whereas PKBA phosphorylation requires simultaneous TORC2 activation and PIP<sub>3</sub> synthesis. This presents a paradox: if TORC2 activation is required for both PKBA and PKBR1, how can overexpression of IMPA restore PKBA phosphorylation without an effect on PKBR1? We noted however that a small amount of PKBA phosphorylation occurs in the absence of TORC2. This is evident in the report from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kamimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Liao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) where PKBA phosphorylation is observed in <italic>pia</italic> mutant cells, which lacks the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> homologue of TORC2 component Rictor. We also observed PKBA phosphorylation in a <italic>rip3</italic> null mutant, lacking a second component of TORC2 (Supplemental Figure 1, top), but an absence of PKBR1 phosphorylation. We propose that elevation of PIP<sub>3</sub>, as a consequence of IMPA overexpression, brings more PKBA to the membrane where it is phosphorylated through a TORC2-independent kinase. The identity of this kinase is not known, but a possible candidate could be the PDK1 homologue PdkA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kamimura and Devreotes, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Liao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Although both PdkA and its paralogue can function in the cytosol, PdkA can translocate to the plasma membrane in response to cAMP through binding to PIP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kamimura and Devreotes, 2010</xref>), and so IMPA overexpression could enhance PKBA phosphorylation by increasing the concentration of both PKBA and PdkA on the membrane. Furthermore, <italic>PKBR1</italic> null cells undergo normal chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Meili <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), indicating that PKBA phosphorylation alone is sufficient for chemotaxis.</p><p>Further apparent complexity relates to earlier results concerning the effects of lithium on <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemotaxis. Lithium inhibits both GSK3 and IMPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Van Lookeren Campagne <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Van Dijken <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ryves <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Ryves and Harwood, 2001</xref>) and therefore would be expected to produce the strong chemotaxis effect seen in the <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant. However, previously we found that lithium treatment of aggregation competent wild-type cells suppressed PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling, but left PKBR1 phosphorylation and cAMP synthesis unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">King <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We demonstrated that this result arose from inhibition of IMPA, leading to a decrease in PIP<sub>2</sub> and subsequent PIP<sub>3</sub> synthesis. Arguing against the possibility that GskA becomes insensitive to lithium, we found that nuclear export of Dd-STATa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Ginger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), which is mediated by GskA phosphorylation, is suppressed by lithium in aggregation competent cells (Supplemental Figure 1, bottom left). We therefore propose that these differences arise through the timing of GskA action. Acute inhibition of GskA in aggregation competent cells, practically defined as cells pulsed with cAMP for 4 h before addition of lithium for 1 h, has no effect on chemotaxis or cAMP synthesis. In contrast, loss of GskA activity at the beginning of development or in growth phase cells causes the block to chemotaxis and signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we found that long-term treatment with lithium present from the initiation of cell development caused a substantial suppression of cAMP synthesis (Supplemental Figure 1, bottom right). This suggests that GskA activity acts as a permissive signal to initiate or set up chemotaxis but is not required continuously either as a direct requirement within the chemotaxis response or for maintenance of a chemotactic competent state. How GskA may achieve this is unclear; however, possibilities could range from constitutive phosphorylation of a protein that acts upstream of PIP<sub>3</sub> and TORC2 signaling to regulation of gene expression of a component, or components, required for chemotaxis and signaling.</p><p>What is clear is that GskA is required in the regulation of some aggregation-specific gene expression. Here, we have shown decreased expression in both <italic>pdsA</italic>, a cAMP phosphodiesterase, and <italic>acaA</italic>, the adenylyl cyclase required for generation of cAMP during aggregation. Loss of expression of these genes could account for loss of cAMP signaling during aggregation, but not the GskA requirement for chemotaxis. The earlier proteomic and microarray analysis of <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Strmecki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) indicates several genes that may contribute to the chemotaxis phenotype. Loss of <italic>gskA</italic> reduces expression of <italic>sodC</italic>, a superoxide dismutase, which has been shown to be required for chemotaxis toward cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Veeranki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The <italic>sodC</italic> mutant causes an increase in RasG activity even in the absence of cAMP stimulation, a known upstream activator of PI3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and could contribute to the higher basal levels of PKBA phosphorylation before cAMP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The microarray also showed that expression of the gene <italic>alrA</italic> is reduced in <italic>gskA</italic> null mutant cells. The AlrA, protein encodes an aldehyde reductase, which when disrupted also suppresses cell motility, although the mechanism is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Ehrenman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Curiously, both GskA and AlrA have the capacity to alter glucose metabolism within the cell, but the significance of this is not known. In contrast, loss of <italic>gskA</italic> elevates expression of <italic>ampA</italic>. The product of this gene is antiadhesion protein that accumulates during aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Varney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and elevated levels of AmpA could explain the instability of the small mounds observed during the aggregation of the <italic>gskA</italic> null.</p><p>Together, this study indicates that GskA is an important regulator of the aggregation process and is essential for cell chemotaxis. Our observations however also indicate that the role of GskA is probably complex, acting through a combination of mechanisms that are required at a minimum for chemotaxis and signaling but that also may include metabolism and cell adhesion. These may integrate to during early development to allow aggregation proceed to the multicellular stage, in which GskA mediates cell fate determination.</p></sec>
