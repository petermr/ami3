These methods provide the necessary protocols for consistent terminology and quantification of xylem resin ducts, which will also allow easier cross-comparison among studies in the future. We describe the basic work flow to build a resin duct chronology, including tree core preparation, procedures to image and measure individual ducts, and software code to compile duct measurements into a complete chronology with both standardized and unstandardized duct metrics for further analyses (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>General workflow of measuring axial resin ducts in tree secondary xylem to build a master chronology of standardized and unstandardized metrics.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0001">Fig 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Core collection and preparation for measurement</title><p id="para0007">Our methods focus on quantification of xylem resin ducts and assume the reader has knowledge of tree core collection and processing. We refer readers to Stokes and Smiley <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and Speer <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> for details on collecting, mounting, preparing, and dating tree cores, but provide tips that are particularly relevant to measuring resin ducts here.</p><p id="para0008"><italic>Increment borer size</italic>: When coring trees or sampling a tree section, the objective is to collect a large enough wood sample such that you have very few rings with no ducts to limit the number of zeros for the statistical analyses. We recommend collecting two cores per tree if using an increment borer that is 5.15 mm in diameter. One core is likely sufficient if using a 10 or 12 mm borer. The larger sized borer is also helpful if you are sampling trees that have been dead for a number of years and contain some rot.</p><p id="para0009"><italic>Core storage</italic>: For 5.15 mm cores, use sturdy paper straws, such as Aardvark (Aardvark Straws, Ft. Wayne, IN, USA), to allow cores to air dry and prevent mold growth. These straws will not disintegrate in light rain and are easy to write on, yet still pliable enough to crimp the ends or join together to contain longer corers. After completing a plot or day, use newspaper to wrap the straws together to safely store them without danger of bending. Again, it is important to use permeable material to allow cores to dry and not mold. One benefit of bundling samples by plot or day is that mistakes in writing core data on the straws (e.g. tree ID, date, plot) can often be resolved based on the other cores in the bundle. For the larger 10&#x02013;12 mm diameter cores, 12.6 mm (0.5 in) PVC pipe can be used to store cores with masking tape applied to the ends to secure and label the cores. Small drill holes can be added to facilitate drying and prevent mold. Drying cores for resin duct measurement is consistent with standard tree core preparation techniques. Air drying of cores typically takes approximately one week, but will vary by the humidity and temperature of the storing environment. Oven-drying is an option if time is limited, but it is not necessary. If oven-drying, the cores can be kept in their paper straws or PVC pipes in a 50&#x02013;60 <sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C oven for 1-2 days. Cores do not need to be completely devoid of moisture, just dry enough so that no shrinkage occurs after mounting.</p><p id="para0010"><italic>Mounting</italic>: After cores are dried, they are ready to be mounted. It is important to orient the cores correctly such that the transverse plane or cross-section is facing up. Cores mounted incorrectly cannot be used to measure axial resin ducts. Look for the jagged lines on either side of the core &#x02013; these are from tracheids being ripped in half lengthwise &#x02013; and should be on the core sides when mounted. If the jagged lines referred to are not immediately visible, the core can be held in two hands and rolled back and forth. The ripped tracheids on either side of the core should reflect light and &#x0201c;glimmer&#x0201d;. One can also look at the end of the core to examine whether the tracheids are oriented vertically. As it is imperative that cores be mounted correctly, we direct readers unfamiliar with mounting techniques to Stokes and Smiley <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> or Speer <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> for further detail.</p><p id="para0011"><italic>Surface preparation</italic>: Surface preparation is particularly important for measuring resin ducts. Taking the time to prepare surfaces will save time later, as it is difficult to discern true resin ducts on surfaces that have been incorrectly prepared. In <italic>Pinus</italic> species, resin ducts are surrounded by thin-walled epithelial cells that synthesize resin and secrete it into the lumen for storage and delivery (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A). Our method of axial resin duct measurement includes both the lumen and the epithelial parenchyma cells together and describes preparing tree cores by sanding. We recommend the sanding method for surface preparation when it is necessary to measure ducts over numerous years for many cores. Other methods such as tissue sections prepared for light microscopy allow more detailed measurement, such as number of epithelial cells and lumen area, but are infeasible for large sample sizes and are impractical when such detail is not needed. We have tried preparing cores by sledge microtome. The microtome has the advantage over sanding of not filling lumens with sawdust (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B), but the resin creates a very shiny surface that makes it difficult to create a good image for measuring over a full tree core length. Sanding creates images that can be reliably measured over a whole core, but it does create variations in duct color, with some ducts getting packed with sawdust and some remaining open (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C).<fig id="fig0002"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>(A) Stained tissue cross section slide showing epithelial parenchyma cells surrounding an axial resin duct and ray parenchyma stained blue.

Arrows in B and C show axial resin ducts embedded within annual rings.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0002">Fig 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="para0012">When sanding cores, the goal is to give each sample such a fine, flat surface that the cell structure is clearly visible when viewed under a dissecting scope. Rings should be clearly distinguishable on a well-prepared surface, with even very narrow rings visible to the naked eye. Sanding should be done using progressively finer grits. It is essential to not skip any of the grit levels. We recommend using a belt sander and a 120, 220, 320, and 400 grit progression. It is important to sand the cores evenly to create a flat surface and avoid a rounded edge for scanning. Afterwards, hand polish as needed with 40, 30, 15, and 9 micron polishing paper. The goal for each grit is to remove all the scratches from the previous grit. Use a hand lens or dissecting scope frequently while learning. When sanding samples from pines (<italic>Pinus</italic> spp.) in particular, resin may smear across the surface of cores if they become hot when sanding. It is best to minimize the possibility of this occurring by letting the cores and sander cool between grits and not sanding for prolonged periods of time. After sanding is finished, clean dust from the cores with compressed air.</p><p id="para0013"><italic>Crossdating</italic>: Dating the core to have high confidence in the calendar year in which each ring formed is essential. Noting decadal years, missing or false rings with pencil marks during dating and prior to scanning will help keep your ring width and resin duct measurements lined up correctly. Again, consult Stokes and Smiley <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> or Speer <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> for more detailed information and strategies on crossdating.</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><title>Image scanning</title><p id="para0014">Thoroughly clean the cores prior to scanning because any trace of debris will show up on the image greatly magnified (<xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). We suggest first using a piece of leather or chamois cloth to pull out remaining sanding dust on each core, followed by a blast of compressed air. Next make sure the scanner bed is free of dust; compressed air also works well here. Glass cleaner comes in handy to remove fingerprints.<fig id="fig0003"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>(A) Prepared, cleaned cores ready for scanning. (B) Cores placed on the scanner just before scanning.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0003">Fig 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="para0015">Use a flatbed scanner with an optical resolution capability of at least 2400 DPI (e.g. Epson Expression 11000XL) to create high-quality images of the cores. Place the cores on the glass and carefully lower the cover to not move the cores. Several cores can be placed on the scanner at one time (<xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B). If necessary, a weight (e.g. a heavy book) may be placed on the scanner lid to help hold samples in place when scanning. It helps to develop a system when handling cores to make each step go smoothly &#x02013; decide on an orientation such as pith to the left side &#x02013; and treat all cores the same way. Now the cores are ready for scanning. We use the following settings and steps to create an individual TIFF file of each core, but this may change slightly depending on the scanner brand and software version (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>):<list list-type="simple" id="celist0002"><list-item id="celistitem0004"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para0016">Adjust settings: In &#x0201c;Professional&#x0201d; mode, ensure resolution is at least 1200 DPI but not more than 2400. Scanning at 1200 DPI is ideal as the time to scan and file size are far less than 2400 DPI, but if the core has particularly narrow rings, 2400 DPI may be necessary.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para0017">Preview scan: Click the &#x0201c;Preview&#x0201d; button.

Our R script requires using the naming convention that follows the Tucson format in which sample IDs (i.e., series ID) are limited to 8 characters and in which ring width measurements are stored in RWL files. For example: letter site ID, core number, core ID: SNF383La.tif, CA15a.tif. It is important for sample IDs in RWL files to be consistent with names of individual TIFF files created in this step.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Ring width measurements</title><p id="para0023">Ring width measurements are necessary for calculating resin duct metrics from tree cores. Any tree ring software will work to measure ring widths and create a ring width chronology. We use CooRecorder for measuring ring widths and CDendro for creating ring width chronologies (Cybis Elekronik &#x00026; Data AB, Saltsj&#x000f6;baden, Sweden). We additionally use COFECHA to check crossdating accuracy (Holmes 1983). The output from this step should be a RWL file. We explain steps directly relevant to measuring resin ducts here, but not the basics of using the software.</p><p id="para0024">When opening TIFF files for ring measurement in CooRecorder, always double check that DPI is listed correctly (e.g. 1200 or 2400). Once ring widths for all cores within a chronology have been measured, they can be imported into CDendro where a ring width chronology (RWL file) can be built. CDendro gives the option to save ring measurements to 0.01 mm or 0.001 mm when creating RWL files in the Tucson format (see Settings &#x0003e; More settings); either will work. When saving a chronology as an RWL file in CDendro select either option to save as a Tucson .rwl file.</p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><title>Resin duct measurements</title><p id="para0025">For measuring ducts, you will need image processing software installed on your computer, a dissecting scope, and the cores all within easy reach (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). The human eye can discern more detail and nuances using a dissecting scope than from a scanned image. We are unaware of a method to accurately detect and measure resin ducts automatically within an image. While such a program may be developed, it would be difficult to account for the high color variability within and among cores across multiple species and the user would still need to verify resin ducts visually by examining the tree core under a dissecting scope. Therefore, to accurately identify ducts, it is important to alternate between the image on the monitor and looking at the core under the scope. Before you start measuring ducts, we recommend spending time to look at many of the cores to see the variation and get a feel for what resin ducts look like. Appearances can change by species (<xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>).<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Example of a workstation prepared to measure resin ducts.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0005">Fig 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig><fig id="fig0006"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Examples of resin ducts from different pine species.

RWL files should be placed in the same directory as the CSV file of unstandardized metrics prior to executing this section. The code computes ring area using the RWL files and the average width of the core (e.g. 5.15 mm). Core width is easy to obtain using the straight line measuring tool in ImageJ or by using the inside diameter of the increment borer. If users want to use ring-level core width measurements to calculate ring area, they will need to modify the provided code.

An accurate ring width file is the foundation for building the final resin duct chronology and time should be spent to ensure that all cores included are datable for the time period of interest. As noted above, we recommend adding years to each resin duct file immediately after duct measurement is completed for an individual core rather than in batches, and have thus set up Section 1 of the R script to function in this way. This will reduce time spent correcting errors in years not aligning correctly because the image of the core in question is still fresh in your mind. If an error in years occurs, you can either correct it by hand in the TXT file or redo the resin duct measurements for that core. We find it easier to correct the TXT file by inserting year breaks, deleting double counted ducts, etc. rather than starting over in ImageJ. After the master resin duct chronology is created, basic data plotting will allow checking for implausibly large or small values.</p><p id="para0064">We encourage archiving data in a publicly accessible repository such as the International Tree-Ring Databank (ITRDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring" id="interref0004a">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring</ext-link>).
