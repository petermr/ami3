Here we show evidence that EBLNs encode functional proteins in their host. Some afrotherian EBLNs were observed to have been maintained for more than 83.3 million years under negative selection. Splice variants were expressed from the genomic loci of EBLNs in elephant, and some were translated into proteins. The EBLN proteins appeared to be localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in African elephant cells, in contrast to the nuclear localization of bornavirus N. These observations suggest that afrotherian EBLNs have acquired a novel function in their host. Interestingly, genomic sequences of the first exon and its flanking regions in these EBLN loci were homologous to those of transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B). The upstream region of the first exon in the EBLN loci exhibited a promoter activity, suggesting that the ability of these EBLNs to be transcribed in the host cell was gained through capturing a partial duplicate of TMEM106B. In conclusion, our results strongly support for exaptation of EBLNs to encode host proteins in afrotherians.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Endogenous retroviruses are representative of endogenous viral elements (EVEs), which are known to have occasionally served as the source of evolutionary innovations of the host. Endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoprotein element (EBLN) was the first EVE identified in mammalian genomes to have been derived from a non-retroviral RNA virus. Here we show evidence that EBLNs that were integrated into afrotherian genomes more than 83.3 million years ago have gained novel protein functions associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum in afrotherians. In the amino acid sequence of EBLN proteins, negative selection appeared to have operated more strongly on hydrophilic regions than on hydrophobic regions, suggesting that EBLN proteins may interact with other molecules in their host cells. In addition, we clarified the mechanism how EBLNs have acquired an ability to be transcribed in the host cell; they captured a partial duplicate of an intrinsic gene, transmembrane protein 106B, which retained an intrinsic promoter activity. Our findings suggest that not only retroviral EVEs but also non-retroviral EVEs may have contributed to the host evolution.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007683</institution-id><institution>Nihon University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>Yuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Strategic Research Base Development Program, &#x0201c;International joint research and training of young researchers for zoonosis control in a globalized world&#x0201d;, and a matching fund subsidy from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>S1491007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>Yuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by research grants from College of Bioresource Sciences, Nihon University, and the Strategic Research Base Development Program, &#x0201c;International joint research and training of young researchers for zoonosis control in a globalized world&#x0201d;, and a matching fund subsidy from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (S1491007) to YK.

Retroviruses are known as a major source of EVEs, such that approximately 8% of the human genome consists of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These EVEs not only serve as molecular fossil records representing the development of ancient to modern relationships between retroviruses and hosts, but also occasionally contribute to the evolution of hosts through exaptation [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, the <italic>Syncytin</italic> genes derived from envelope genes of retroviruses are involved in placentation in mammals [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, some ERVs are involved in EVE-derived immunity (EDI), which acts as an anti-virus factor against exogenous retrovirus infections [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Recently, EVEs derived from non-retroviral DNA and RNA viruses were discovered in many eukaryotic genomes [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An endogenous bornavirus-like element (EBL) was the first EVE identified to be derived from a non-retroviral RNA virus in mammalian genomes [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. EBLs are most closely related to bornavirus, which is a mononegavirus encoding a nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), and accessory protein (X) [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To date EBLs derived from N, M, G, and L genes have been identified and designated as EBLN, EBLM, EBLG, and EBLL, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some EBL sequences are apparently initiated with a bornavirus transcription start site and ended with a polyA and flanked by target-site duplications (TSDs), suggesting that they were generated through the LINE-1 machinery [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>EBLNs are found in the genomes of diverse animals including snakes, turtles, moles, rodents, primates, and afrotherians [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ORFs found in EBLNs are in most cases fragmented by premature termination codons, although occasionally EBLNs with relatively long ORFs have been identified. Haplorhini primates have maintained an EBLN encoding 366 amino acids (aa), which is similar in length to bornavirus N (370 aa), for more than 40 million years (MY). However, no natural selection has been detected on primate EBLNs at the amino acid sequence level [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thirteen-lined ground squirrel (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>) has harbored an EBLN (itEBLN) encoding 207 aa for ~0.3 MY [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recombinant itEBLN protein conferred resistance to bornavirus infection on human cells by being incorporated into bornavirus particles as incompetent nucleoproteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting a possibility that itEBLN might act as an EDI protein, which should be tested in thirteen-lined ground squirrel. Overall, there is little evidence indicating that EBLNs encode a functional protein in their hosts.</p><p>Here, in a search for EBLNs that have been co-opted to encode functional proteins in the host, we investigated afrotherian EBLNs containing relatively long ORFs. Afrotherians are a diverse group of mammals that originated in Africa 83.3 MY ago (MYA) [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The superorder Afrotheria includes orders Proboscidea (e.g., elephant), Sirenia (e.g., dugong and manatee), Hyracoidea (e.g., hyracoid), Macroscelidea (e.g., elephant-shrew), Tubulidentata (e.g., aardvark), and Tenrecoidea (e.g., tenrec and golden mole) [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We present evidence for the existence of EBLNs encoding functional proteins and their evolutionary mechanisms in afrotherians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Finding afrotherian EBLNs encoding functional proteins</title><p>Using the amino acid sequence of bornavirus N (strain name: H1499, accession number: AY374520) as the query, a tBLASTn search was conducted against whole genome shotgun sequences of afrotherians (taxid: 311790) on June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2015. A total of 25 EBLNs were identified from African elephant (<italic>Loxodonta africana</italic>), rock hyrax (<italic>Procavia capensi</italic>), Florida manatee (<italic>Trichechus manatus latirostris</italic>), Cape golden mole (<italic>Chrysochloris asiatica</italic>), Cape elephant shrew (<italic>Elephantulus edwardii</italic>), and aardvark (<italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>), with an e-value threshold of E-20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005785.s016">S1 Table</xref>). Two EBLNs each in African elephant, rock hyrax, Florida manatee, Cape elephant shrew, and aardvark contained relatively long ORFs encoding 341&#x02013;350 aa, which were similar in length to bornavirus N (370 aa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005785.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Although two EBLNs were identified in Cape golden mole, the ORF of one EBLN (Ca/AMDV01031468) was separated into two fragments encoding 196 aa and 142 aa. The other EBLN (Ca/AMDV01100225) contained an ORF encoding 314 aa, which showed the highest amino acid sequence identity of 53% to bornavirus N among the afrotherian EBLNs identified in this study.</p><p>In the phylogenetic tree of afrotherian EBLNs and bornavirus N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005785.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005785.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), all EBLNs encoding 341&#x02013;350 aa as well as the EBLN of Cape golden mole with separated ORFs (Ca/AMDV01031468) formed a monophyletic cluster (cluster I). The topology of cluster I EBLNs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005785.g001">Fig 1A</xref> reflected that of the host species [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, the flanking genomic nucleotide sequences of cluster I EBLNs were alignable between afrotherians (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005785.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting that cluster I EBLNs originated from a single integration event of viral N gene into the genome of ancestral afrotherians more than 83.3 MYA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005785.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Afrotherian EBLNs with fragmented ORFs formed another cluster (cluster II), which contained EBLNs from African elephant, Folorida manatee, and aardvark. When EBLN sequences identified from non-afrotherian species were added to the phylogenetic tree, cluster I EBLNs and cluster II EBLNs were still monophyletic and constituted a larger cluster with Strepsirrhini EBLNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005785.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that afrotherians have suffered from infection by bornavirus-like virus from the time of their origin and that colonizaiton of EBLNs has occurred at least twice during evolution of afrotherians.</p><fig id="ppat.1005785.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005785.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Molecular evolutionary analyses of afrotherian EBLNs.</title><p>(A) Phylogenetic tree for EBLNs and bornavirus N constructed by the neighnour-joing method based on the amino acid sequences.

Cluster I EBLNs originated from a single integration event of N mRNA from a bornavirus-like virus into the ancestral genome of afrotherians through the LINE-1 machinery more than 83.3 MYA, which overlaps with the time period when LINE-1 was active in afrotherians [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the other hand, cluster II EBLNs were observed only in the genomes of African elephant, Florida manatee, and aardvark, suggesting that the integration event of cluster II EBLNs into the afrotherian genomes may have taken place relatively recently compared to cluster I EBLNs.</p><p>Amino acid sequences encoded by relatively long ORFs in cluster I EBLNs have been negatively selected, suggesting that they were co-opted in afrotherians as functional proteins. In contrast, ORFs in cluster II EBLNs were fragmented and apparently have evolved without functional constraint at the amino acid sequence level. The difference in the fates of cluster I and cluster II EBLN ORFs may have stemmed from the presence or absence of a partial duplicate of TMEM106B upstream of EBLNs in the genome. The promoter and TSS of human TMEM106B are located in the CpG island (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005785.s015">S15 Fig</xref>), which is known to be associated with ubiquitously expressed genes such as house keeping genes, and human TMEM106B mRNA has been reported to be expressed ubiquitously [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the genome of African elephant, GC content in the 100 nt upstream of laEBLN-1v1/1v2 and laEBLN-2v1/2v2 is 65% and 61%, respectively, suggesting that the promoter and TSS of these mRNAs are also located in the CpG island. Indeed, the overall expression of laEBLN-1v1/1v2 and laEBLN-2v1/2v2 was ubiquitous in elephant. It is conceivable that the partial duplicate of TMEM106B provided cluster I EBLNs with an opportunity to be transcribed ubiquitously in afrotherians, which may have facilitated the EBLN proteins to acquire novel functions in the host before the occurrence of deleterious mutations in the ORF. It should be noted, however, that acquisition of intrinsic promoter and TSS may not be necessary for transcription of EBLNs in the host cell, because all of seven EBLNs in human were shown to be transcribed in some tissues although their association with intrinsic promoters and TSS has not been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, mRNAs containing the cluster II African elephant EBLN (La/AAGU03023585, RNAseq accession number: XM_010588552) and the Cape golden mole EBLN encoding 314 aa (Ca/AMDV01100225, RNAseq accession number: XM_006861214) were found in the RNAseq database. It is possible that mRNAs containing these EBLNs were not expressed in sufficiently large numbers of tissues for acquisition of novel functions in the host before the occurrence of deleterious mutations in the ORF. However, it should also be noted that the protein function once acquired by EBLNs can be lost during evolution of the hosts. In afrotherians, the ORF of cluster I EBLN in Cape golden mole (Ca/AMDV0103146) was separated into two fragments, and Lesser hedgehog tenrec (<italic>Echionps telfairi</italic>) contained only remnants of cluster I EBLNs (contig accession numbers: AAIY02040498 and AAIY02084943), which could not be detected by the tBLASTn search conducted in this study. Interestingly, these species are closely related as members of Tenrecoidea. These information may be useful for understanding the protein function of cluster I EBLNs in other species.</p><p>Cluster I EBLNs were tandemly duplicated in afrotherian genomes, and were transcribed in alternatively spliced forms in African elephant, generating laEBLN-1v1, laEBLN-1v2, laEBLN-2v1, and laEBLN-2v2. Although these mRNAs as a whole appeared to be expressed ubiquitously, the expression profile of laEBLN-2v2 was diversified from those of laEBLN-1v1, laEBLN-1v2, and laEBLN-2v1. In addition, protein products of laEBLN-1v1 and laEBLN-2v1 were expected to be different from those of laEBLN-1v2 and laEBLN-2v2 at the C-terminal 20 aa, and the FLAG-tagged laEBLN-1v1 and His-tagged laEBLN-1v2 proteins showed different subcellular localizations in elephant cells. These observations were indicative of a functional differentiation among laEBLN proteins. Nevertheless, the splice donor site (GU) for the second intron to generate laEBLN-1v2 and laEBLN-2v2 were identified only in elephant, manatee, and hylax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005785.g009">Fig 9A</xref>), suggesting that expression of splice variants corresponding to laEBLN-1v2 and laEBLN-2v2 may be limited to these species. It was unclear whether these species gained or other species lost the splice variants because these scenarios were equally likely from the inference of ancestral sequences at the splice donor site according to the parsimony principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005785.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat.1005785.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005785.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Splice donor sites in the second intron of afrotherian EBLNs.</title><p>(A) Splice donor sites in the second intron of afrotherian EBLNs are surrounded by a red-boxed line.

In contrast, bornavirus infection was not suppressed by the protein product of hsEBLN-1, which shared 41% of amino acid sequence with bornavirus N. The amino acid sequences encoded by afrotherian EBLNs were more divergent from bornavirus N than the sequence encoded by hsEBLN-1. In addition, endogenous laEBLN protein was observed to be localized to the rER in African elephant cells, which was in sharp contrast to the fact that bornavirus N is localized to the nucleus in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These observations suggest that laEBLN proteins have acquired a novel function associated with rER in afrotherian cells.</p><p>The rER is associated with ribosomes and involved in the translation of cytoplasmic, secretory, and membrane proteins. There are mechanisms to deliver mRNAs from the cytoplasm to the rER membrane by the action of RNA-binding proteins, such as STAU1, STAU2, Pum1, and Pum2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005785.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Because mononegavirus N has an ability to bind to RNA and laEBLN proteins are localized to rER, it is interesting to assess the involvement of laEBLN proteins in mRNA delivery.
