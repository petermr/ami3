    "Rhinocoetanamaqua sp. nov. is recognised as a separate species from its closest relative, R.cornuta (Fabricius, 1781) after a review and close analysis of specimens recently collected in the semiarid region of the Northern Cape Province, South Africa. The new species can be readily separated from R.cornuta by the drastically reduced tubercle and associated depression on its anterior pronotal margin, particularly in the male. In addition, the general body shape of R.namaqua is more globose than that of R.cornuta, its average total length is larger, and its elytral costae are generally reduced and poorly visible, particularly at the level of the umbones. These characteristics make it practically impossible to separate the two sexes of R.namaqua, without inspection of the internal reproductive organs, as their external morphologies are virtually identical, unlike in R.cornuta. Finally, the aedeagal parameres of R.namaqua exhibit a narrower apex than those of R.cornuta and, in particular, lack the subapical hook-shaped lateral expansions that are so typical of all the other Rhinocoeta s. str. species. The new species appears to be restricted to specific bioregions of the Succulent and Nama Karoo biomes of the Northern Cape, and like all other species of the genus is generally found on or under mammal herbivore dung. Adult activity is limited to short periods immediately after rainfall events, during which individuals fly around and mate, but do not feed on either fruits or flowers."
