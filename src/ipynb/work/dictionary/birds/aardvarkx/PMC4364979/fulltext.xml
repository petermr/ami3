Females were subjected to ovarian dissection and were defined as perinatal flies, assumed to have entered burrows to larviposit, if oocyte sizes indicated &#x0003e;95% pregnancy completion. Perinatal flies were defined as full-term pregnant if there was a late third instar larva <italic>in utero</italic>, or postpartum if the uterus was empty. All other females were defined as pre-full-term pregnant (pre-FT). Of 845 G. m. morsitans captured, 91% (765) were female and 295/724 (41%) of females dissected were perinatal flies. By contrast, of 2805 <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> captured only 71% (2003) were female and only 33% (596/1825) of females were perinatal. Among all perinatal females 67% (596/891) were <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic>.

Catches of males and pre-FT females increased strongly with temperatures above 32&#x000b0;C, indicating that these flies used burrows as refuges from high ambient temperatures. Conversely, catches of perinatal females changed little with maximum temperature but declined from late September through November: females may anticipate that burrows will be inundated during the forthcoming wet season. Ovarian age distributions of perinatal and pre-FT females were similar, consistent with all ages of females larvipositing in burrows with similar probability.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Artificial warthog burrows provide a novel method for collecting tsetse pupae, studying tsetse behaviour at larviposition, assessing the physiological status of female tsetse and their larvae, and of improving understanding of the physiological dynamics of terminal pregnancy, and population dynamics generally, with a view to improving methods of trypanosomiasis control.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Adult tsetse, vectors of trypanosomiasis, have been extensively studied for more than 100 years, but little is known about larviposition behaviour in the field. Pupae are generally collected in the field via arduous searches of putative larviposition sites. Females have never been sampled in the field as they deposit a larva, leading to confusion about the physiological dynamics at the end of pregnancy. We overcome these problems through the use of artificial warthog burrows, where tsetse deposit pupae during the hot dry season in the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe. When burrows were fitted with a retaining trap it was also possible to sample perinatal (full-term pregnant and postpartum) female tsetse. Comparisons of the numbers of pupae deposited in burrows without the trap, with the numbers of perinatal flies trapped in burrows, showed that many full-term pregnant female tsetse enter burrows but then leave without depositing a larva. <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> are more discriminating in this regard than <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic>. Capture of perinatal females will make it possible, for the first time, to compare the physiological status of female tsetse and the pupa they have just deposited, with important implications for the understanding of tsetse population dynamics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SACEMA receives core funding from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of South Africa.

Our knowledge of the (briefly free-living) larval and pupal stages is, by contrast, limited mainly to laboratory studies [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Studies on the physiology of reproduction in tsetse[<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], showed that they have a very unusual reproductive system, termed <italic>adenotrophic viviparity</italic>. Unlike most Diptera, which lay large numbers of small eggs that hatch to produce free-living larvae, tsetse have just two ovarioles in each of the left and right ovaries and only produce one large egg at a time. The egg is retained in the uterus, fertilized there by sperm stored in the female&#x02019;s spermathecae, and hatches after 4&#x02013;6 days to produce a first instar larva. This larval stage, and two subsequent instars, are fed via a highly modified uterine or milk gland producing ultimately a late third instar larva that often constitutes more than 50% of the female&#x02019;s total body mass. In the field a full-term third instar larva is typically deposited in sand, or soft soil, covered with leaf litter. The larva burrows a few centimetres into the substrate and rapidly forms around itself a hard, waterproof, puparial case of chitin. Inside this puparial case the fly goes through the larval, pre-pupal, pupal and pharate adult stages before emerging as the teneral adult fly some weeks after larviposition, the period depending on temperature.</p><p>Whereas this process has been studied in the laboratory, it is extremely unusual to observe female tsetse larvipositing in the field: indeed it is uncommon to find female tsetse with a full-term larva <italic>in utero</italic> and this difficulty has led to some uncertainty regarding the physiological status of female flies at terminal stages of pregnancy [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Field studies have accordingly been limited to finding puparia that have already been deposited. This involves methodical searches of suspected larviposition sites&#x02014;under fallen logs and rocks, in rot-holes in trees, in shaded places on the edges of dry river-beds, or in loose soil, or sand, covered with leaf litter [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In Zimbabwe, from August to November, tsetse puparia can frequently be found in burrows dug by the aardvark <italic>Orycteropus afer</italic> Pallas and often used thereafter by warthog <italic>Phacochoerus aethiopicus</italic> Pallas [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Muzari &#x00026; Hargrove showed that female tsetse larviposit in artificial versions of these &#x02018;warthog burrows&#x02019;[<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

The original study was concerned only with the collection of puparia, but a device was also described whereby flies could be captured in the burrows. The primary purpose of the present study was, for the first time in tsetse fieldwork, to sample full-term pregnant flies just before they deposited a larva. More generally we studied the sample characteristics of this new capture system. Our null hypotheses were that: the exact location of larviposition was independent of burrow site and orientation; that the larviposition site within each burrow was randomly chosen; that these choices were the same for both species and for females of different ages; that the timing of larviposition was random throughout the day and that a full-term pregnant fly entering a burrow deposited its larva in that burrow.</p><p>Since warthog burrows are always cooler than ambient during daylight hours [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it seemed likely that tsetse would also use the burrows as &#x0201c;refuge&#x0201d; sites&#x02014;the cooler dark places where flies are found in increasingly large numbers as temperatures increase above 32<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accordingly we also studied the effects of calendar time and temperature on the sex and species distribution of captured flies and, particularly for female flies, the distribution between full-term pregnant, and other, females.</p><p>The study suggested that female tsetse do not larviposit randomly with respect to time, nor with position within burrows, and that full-term flies often enter a burrow but then leave it without larvipositing. This behaviour differed between species. The research opens the door for an entirely new area of tsetse studies&#x02014;including comparisons between the physiological status of individual females and the pupae they have just deposited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Artificial warthog burrows</title><p>During 1998, 36 artificial warthog burrows were deployed over a distance of 800m along the banks of the Chiuyi and Rukomechi Rivers near Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe.

Flies entering the burrow flew under the lip of the trap and were retained when they headed towards the light. When the trap was not in place, female flies could deposit their larvae in the plastic trays, which were half-filled with sand, on top of which was placed a <italic>c</italic>. 2cm layer of leaf litter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0003565.g001"/></fig><p>For each of the 20 burrows at sites 1 to 5 a wire-framed, net-covered, trap was inserted into the mouth of a burrow, such that tsetse could enter the burrow but were trapped when they flew out towards the light (<xref rid="pntd.0003565.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Between 8 September and 25 November traps were cleared daily at <italic>c</italic>. 1115, 1230, 1400 and 1645 h. With this regularity of clearing, it was possible to collect &#x0201c;perinatal&#x0201d; female flies&#x02014;<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., postpartum flies that had just deposited a larva, or full-term pregnancy flies which generally produced a larva soon after capture. Male flies, and females that were not perinatal, were also collected and counted.</p><p>The 16 burrows at sites 6 to 9 were always used without a trap so that adult females could enter and leave the burrow unhindered. Flies entering these burrows could deposit larvae in one of six sand-filled plastic trays placed on the bottom of the burrow or could leave the burrow without depositing a pupa. The positions of any puparia deposited were noted as being found in the left or right column of trays and in the back, middle or front tray, as viewed from the burrow entrance. The idea of this experiment was to study larviposition site selection, in terms of burrow orientation and position within the burrow, with a view to maximising future puparial collection rates. The experiment also facilitated study of the variation of larviposition rates, for each of the two tsetse species, as a function of calendar date and temperature. Puparia were collected from the trays in these burrows, at 3&#x02013;18 day intervals, between 28 August and 8 November.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Ovarian dissection</title><p>Adult tsetse from burrow traps were placed, with any puparium found in the trap that could be attributed unequivocally to the female fly in question, in individually labelled (75 x 25)-mm glass tubes which were kept under a black cloth in a polystyrene box. Larvae could be attributed unequivocally to their mothers if there was only a single larva/pupa, and only one postpartum female, in the trap cage&#x02014;or if a full-term pregnant female was transferred from the capture cage to a glass tube and the female thereafter deposited a larva prior to dissection.</p><p>Adult females were subjected to ovarian dissection, 98% on their day of capture and the remainder the following morning, and assigned to one of eight ovarian age categories, using the disposition and relative sizes of the oocytes within the ovarioles in the left and right ovaries [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This procedure can be used to determine unequivocally the number of times a fly has ovulated as long as this number is less than four. Thereafter, the ovarian category can only be defined modulo 4 [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: thus, it is not possible to differentiate flies that have ovulated four times from those that have ovulated 8, 12, 16 <italic>etc</italic>. times, and similar problems exist for those that have ovulated 5, 6 or 7 times. This did not constitute a problem for the present study since we were not concerned with actual ages of flies but only the ovarian age distributions of different groups.</p><p>Pregnancy stage was assessed from the linear dimensions of the ovarian and uterine contents [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Females which were seen to have produced a larva after the time of capture&#x02014;either in the trap or in the collection tube after removal from the trap, but before ovarian dissection, were classified as &#x0201c;postpartum&#x0201d;. This category was also used for flies which had an empty uterus, and where the sizes of the first and second largest oocytes indicated that the female had completed &#x0003e;95% of the ovulation cycle. It was assumed that these flies had very recently larviposited. Females with a third instar larva <italic>in utero</italic>, of a size indicating that &#x0003e;95% of the pregnancy was complete, were classified as &#x0201c;full-term&#x0201d; pregnant. Postpartum and full-term flies were jointly referred to as &#x0201c;perinatal&#x0201d;. All other female flies were termed &#x0201c;pre-full-term&#x0201d; (abbreviated below to pre-FT). This group includes flies in ovarian category zero, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., flies which had not yet ovulated for the first time, and all flies with either an egg or a first, second, or small third instar larva <italic>in utero</italic>. Finally it includes flies with an empty uterus where the size of the oocytes in the ovaries indicated that the female had completed &#x02264;95% of the ovulation cycle. Note that the empty uterus could have occurred due to natural causes, or to capture-related trauma. For present purposes the cause is not relevant: if oocyte size indicates that &#x02264;95% of pregnancy has been completed then the fly is properly classified as pre-FT&#x02014;regardless of the content of the uterus or, where the uterus is empty, how this came about.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Meteorological measurements</title><p>A mercury thermometer in a Stevenson screen at Rekomitjie Research Station was used to record daily maximum and minimum temperatures.

The burrows were initially designed to provide a simple method for collecting tsetse puparia in the field. It became apparent, however, that the additional use of a trap allowed us to sample adult flies entering the burrows. Initial trials of this system in August 1997 showed that, at that time of the year, the catch consisted entirely of female tsetse that all deposited a larva in the trap. When, as in the current study, sampling was carried out in the hotter months of September to November it became apparent that the burrows, being dark and so much cooler than ambient during daylight hours, fulfil all the requirements of a refuge and were clearly used as such on days when temperatures exceeded about 32<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C.</p><p>The dual function of the burrows complicates the analysis of the data because it becomes necessary to make a judgement about which (female) flies are using the sites as a refuge, and which as a larviposition site. Females that are known to have deposited a larva after entering the burrow are clearly in the perinatal group. The classification is more difficult when the female has a third instar larva <italic>in utero</italic>: we tried to reduce the probability of misclassifying flies into the perinatal group by setting a high threshold (estimated proportion of pregnancy completed &#x0003e; 95%) for the inclusion into that category. Flies at this late/full-term stage of pregnancy could reasonably be assumed to be due to produce a larva on the day of capture. While we cannot exclude the possibility that some flies may have been misclassified, support for our classification algorithm comes from the fact that the presumptive refuge and larviposition groups show such distinctly different patterns in terms of changes in catch with calendar date and temperature, and daily time of entry into the burrows.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Burrows as refuges: Refuges as larviposition sites?</title><p>While artificial burrows, designed as larviposition sites, may double as artificial refuges, the reverse does not seem to be true. When artificial refuges were provided with a floor of river sand, fewer than one puparium per week were found in these sites [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This emphasises the rather precise conditions that female tsetse appear to require of larviposition sites. When tsetse had the choice of larvipositing in trays filled with either plain sand, or sand covered with leaf litter, 97% of all tsetse puparia were found in the latter site [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]: in that study, as in the present one, it was also found that the vast majority of larvae were deposited in the trays furthest to the back of the burrows. The absence of added leaf litter in Vale&#x02019;s (1971) refuge flooring, the slightly warmer conditions in the artificial refuges, and the more exposed situation compared with our burrows, will all presumably have reduced the probability that his refuges would be used as larviposition sites [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Species ratios among tsetse adults and puparia sampled from artificial burrows</title><p>The greater proportion of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> among pupae collected, as against the proportion among perinatal flies captured (cf Tables <xref rid="pntd.0003565.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0003565.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>) might simply reflect differential proportions of adults of the two species around sites 6 to 9, where puparia were collected, and around sites 1 to 5, where adult flies were trapped. Given, however, that the sites were all within a few hundred metres of each other, and were all in similar habitat, this explanation seems unlikely.</p><p>Alternatively the anomaly could reflect a higher level of discrimination among <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> in the selection of larviposition sites. In this scenario, among full-term pregnant females entering a burrow, a greater proportion of the <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> leave the burrow without larvipositing, and a greater proportion of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> deposit a larva. When there is a trap in place, however, full-term pregnant flies that have entered the burrow are prevented from leaving. Those full-term pregnant female <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> that would have left the burrow are now trapped and this changes the balance of the number of perinatal females trapped in favour of this species relative to <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic>.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence are consistent with the above scenario. Firstly, the selection of the trays deepest in the burrows was stronger in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> than in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> (83% vs 74%, <xref rid="pntd.0003565.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Perhaps even deeper/longer burrows will elicit improved larviposition by both species, but particularly by <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic>. Secondly, for <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic>, the yield per site per day of perinatal females (3.29, <xref rid="pntd.0003565.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) was 2.7 times higher than the yield of puparia (1.23, <xref rid="pntd.0003565.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) from burrows where there was no trap and where flies were free to come and go. For <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> the yields were very similar, 1.74 and 1.65, respectively. This is consistent with a larger proportion of full-term pregnancy <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> entering burrows but then leaving, without larvipositing, if they were allowed to do so. Indeed the above figures suggest that for every ten full-term pregnant female <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> entering a burrow, on average perhaps only four would deposit their larvae there. Thirdly, the fact that markedly more <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> than <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> larvae were deposited in the burrows, in an area where the latter species is clearly more numerous [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggests that the artificial burrows were less attractive as larviposition sites to <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> than to <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic>. Fourthly, as reported previously [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the proportion of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> from natural warthog burrows was double the proportion in artificial burrows.</p><p>More carefully controlled experiments will be required to test the tentative idea that many heavily pregnant females entered the burrows but left without larvipositing and that this effect is more accentuated in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic>. This suggests an important determinant of larviposition site selection, but the stimuli and responses underlying this selection are unclear. Similarly, it is not clear what underlies the difference in larviposition responses of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> and <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic>. An impressive array of differences in behavioural responses between tsetse species has been attributed to differences in habitat geometry [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Within habitats, differences in behaviour between species, and between males and females of the same species, were attributed to differences in fly size and mobility. It is possible that the differences in larviposition behaviour observed here between the two species has similar causes. <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> is a larger and more mobile fly than <italic>G</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>morsitans</italic> and may, therefore, be able to visit a greater number of potential sites before larvipositing. The study system described here provides ways of addressing this question and other issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Time course of catches of pre-FT and perinatal female tsetse in burrows</title><p>Temperature-adjusted catches of males and of pre-FT females continue to increase until mid-October, consistent with the idea that the decline prior to that time, in pupal deposition rates in burrows, reflects a falling probability of tsetse larvipositing in burrows, rather than a decline in the population of full-term-pregnant flies in the area. What is less clear is whether females are reacting to any meteorological or other cues in moving away from using the burrows as sites for larviposition. Regression analysis suggests that there is no effect of either ambient relative humidity or saturation deficit: moreover, the small effect of ambient temperature has a positive coefficient which would tend to increase, rather than decrease, the numbers of larvae deposited in the burrows as the hot season progresses. We cannot exclude the possibility that flies were reacting to changes in humidity within burrows, which was not measured here, but should be monitored in future studies.</p><p>Reduced use of warthog burrows as larviposition sites during October and November, reflected both in the reduction in the absolute numbers of perinatal flies captured in burrows, and of puparia found in these sites, may be adaptive. When heavy rains fall, the burrows become waterlogged and may even flood, and any pupae present would presumably perish. In 1998 the first rains only fell on 19 November, whereas the decline in captures of perinatal flies started a month before this time. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for heavy rain to fall in the first half of November; in 5/10 years in the period 1989&#x02013;1998 &#x0003e; 12.5 mm of rain were recorded at Rekomitjie by 15 November. Larvae deposited in the last half of October might not, therefore, have emerged by the time the first heavy rains fell. Over the same period 0/10 years had recorded this level of rain by the end of October. There is therefore little danger of flooding for any flies deposited in burrows during September, but this danger increases in October and particularly November.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Age structures</title><p>It has been argued that refuges provide the least biased sample of tsetse currently available&#x02014;at least in terms of age structure and pregnancy stage [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The similarity between the age structures of perinatal females and those apparently using the burrows as a refuge is then consistent with the idea that all ages of fly use the burrows as larviposition sites with approximately the same probability.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations, conclusions</title><p>For both species, perinatal flies were most often caught before the hottest time of the day (at about 1500h): 45&#x02013;65% were captured by 1230h on any given day and most often larviposited in the collection tube shortly thereafter. We do not know, however, when the flies would have larviposited if they had not been caught, nor even whether they would have larviposited in the burrow where they were caught had they not been trapped. Further field studies are required to better estimate the timing of larviposition in the field.</p><p>Interpretation of catches from burrow traps is also complicated by the unknown efficiency of the traps. On one hand the presence of the trap may have discouraged some flies from entering the burrow. Conversely, traps occasionally contained a pupa that could not have been produced by any of the flies in the trap&#x02014;implying that a postpartum fly had escaped. A better idea of the number of flies entering the burrows could be obtained by deploying electric nets [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] around the entrance of the burrow and/or even inside it.</p><p>The estimate that 60% of full-term <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pallidipes</italic> leave a burrow that they have entered, without larvipositing there, suggests that we should seek ways of improving the burrows such that females are more likely to larviposit in the burrow they first enter. This study, and an earlier one [<xref rid="pntd.0003565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], made no progress in improving on the original burrow design. The use of the burrows as larviposition sites also seems to be limited to about four months of the year and our knowledge of the behaviour of perinatal flies in the field is thus currently limited to just two species of tsetse during a single season. At other times of the year pupae are deposited along the edges of dried up water-courses, in rot holes in trees and under fallen logs. Artificial versions of the latter two sites might be used to sample larvipositing flies at other times of the year at Rekomitjie, and indeed to sample other species in other parts of Africa.</p><p>Currently, the burrows capture system provides the only method for collecting perinatal tsetse in the field, providing thereby a unique opportunity to study the physiology of female tsetse and the larvae that they have just deposited. Future papers will address this interesting new area of tsetse field biology.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mr. William Shereni, Director of the Tsetse Control Department of the Government of Zimbabwe for his continued support and interest.
