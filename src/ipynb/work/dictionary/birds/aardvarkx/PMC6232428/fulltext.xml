Introduction</title><p>Parvoviruses (family <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses that infect vertebrate (subfamily <italic>Parvovirinae</italic>) and invertebrate (subfamily <italic>Densovirinae</italic>) hosts. The small (4&#x02013;6&#x02009;kb) genome is encompassed by characteristic terminal palindromic repeats, which form hairpin-like secondary structures characteristic for each genus (<xref rid="vey026-B49" ref-type="bibr">Tijssen et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Despite exhibiting a low level of sequence similarity, parvovirus genomes are highly conserved in overall structure, containing two large gene cassettes responsible for encoding the nonstructural (NS) and the structural (VP) proteins. The N-terminal region of the minor capsid protein VP1 includes a highly conserved phospholypase A2 (PLA2) motif that is required for escape from the endosomal compartments after entering the host cell (<xref rid="vey026-B52" ref-type="bibr">Zadori et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>). The parvovirus capsid is icosahedral with a T&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 symmetry, displaying a jelly roll fold of conserved &#x003b2;-sheets linked by variable surface loops, designated variable region (VR) I to IX (<xref rid="vey026-B16" ref-type="bibr">Chapman and Agbandje-McKenna 2006</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous parvoviral elements (EPVs) are genomic sequences homologous to parvovriuses that are thought to have been generated when parvoviral DNA sequences were incorporated into the germline of the ancestral host species, such that they were subsequently inherited as host alleles (<xref rid="vey026-B26" ref-type="bibr">Holmes 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B22" ref-type="bibr">Feschotte and Gilbert 2012</xref>). The identification of orthologous EPVs in the genomes of distantly related species demonstrates that these sequences were generated millions of years ago (<xref rid="vey026-B7" ref-type="bibr">Belyi et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B30" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B31" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis and Gifford 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B47" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>), and they can therefore provide a useful source of retrospective information about the longer-term evolutionary relationships between parvoviruses and their hosts.</p><p>
<italic>Amdoparvovirus</italic> is a recently defined genus in the family <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> (<xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). The type species was originally called Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV)&#x02014;hence the genus name. However, AMDV is now considered to represent a variant of the renamed species <italic>Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1</italic> (<xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). AMDV causes an immune complex-associated progressive syndrome in American mink (<italic>Neovison vison</italic>) called Aleutian disease or plasmacytosis (<xref rid="vey026-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et&#x000a0;al. 1994</xref>) which is considered to be one of the most important infectious diseases affecting farm-raised mink (<xref rid="vey026-B12" ref-type="bibr">Canuti et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). AMDV infection is known to be widespread in wild mink as well as in farmed animals (<xref rid="vey026-B11" ref-type="bibr">Canuti et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), and related amdoparvoviruses have been identified in other carnivore species, including raccoon dogs, foxes, skunks, and red pandas (<xref rid="vey026-B40" ref-type="bibr">Pennick et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B45" ref-type="bibr">Shao et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B33" ref-type="bibr">LaDouceur et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alex et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Findings from metagenomic studies suggest that amdoparvoviruses may infect a broader range of mammalian orders (<xref rid="vey026-B34" ref-type="bibr">Lau et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>), but this has yet to be fully demonstrated.</p><p>Phylogenetic studies support a common evolutionary origin for amdoparvoviruses and protoparvoviruses (genus <italic>Protoparvovirus</italic>) (<xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Protoparvoviruses infect a wide range of mammalian hosts, encompassing several distinct mammalian orders (<xref rid="vey026-B49" ref-type="bibr">Tijssen et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B43" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). For example, rodent protoparvoviruses are known for their oncolytic properties (<xref rid="vey026-B38" ref-type="bibr">Marchini et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), while carnivore and ungulate protoparvoviruses are significant pathogens of domestic pets and livestock (<xref rid="vey026-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hueffer and Parrish 2003</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kailasan et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B39" ref-type="bibr">Meszaros et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although they are relatively closely related, amdoparvoviruses and protoparvoviruses are distinguished by certain features of their genomes and replication strategies. In particular, amdoparvovirus mRNAs are transcribed from one single upstream promoter and are polyadenylated at two distinct polyadenylation signals. To provide the VP1 encoding transcript, an intron is spliced out, leaving a short, three amino acid (aa)&#x02013;encoding exon leader sequence (transcribed from a short, upstream ORF) positioned in-frame with the VP ORF (<xref rid="vey026-B42" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). In contrast, the NS- and VP-encoding mRNAs of protoparvoviruses are transcribed from two different promoters, being polyadenylated at a mutual polyadenylation signal close to the 3&#x02032; end of the genome. Although splicing has been reported in the protoparvovirus VP-encoding mRNA, this always occurs within the VP ORF itself (<xref rid="vey026-B49" ref-type="bibr">Tijssen et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Amdoparvoviruses are also unique within the <italic>Parvovirinae</italic> in lacking a PLA2 domain in their VP unique region (VP1u) (<xref rid="vey026-B52" ref-type="bibr">Zadori et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we performed a systematic screen of 688 animal genomes to identify EPVs disclosing similarity to amdoparvoviruses. We identify and characterize six such EPVs, examining their genomic, phylogenetic and protein structural characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Methods</title><sec><title>2.1 <italic>In silico</italic> genome screening</title><p>We used the database-integrated genome screening (DIGS) tool (<xref rid="vey026-B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>) to screen whole-genome sequence (WGS) assemblies for EPVs. The DIGS tool provides a framework for similarity-search&#x02013;based genome screening. It uses the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) program (<xref rid="vey026-B3" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et&#x000a0;al. 1997</xref>) to systematically screen WGS files for sequences matching to a nucleotide or peptide &#x02018;probe&#x02019;. Sequences that disclose above-threshold similarity to the probe are extracted and classified, with results being captured in an MySQL relational database (<xref rid="vey026-B6" ref-type="bibr">Axmark and Widenius 2015</xref>). To identify EPVs, we used parvovirus peptide sequences to screen all 362 vertebrate genome assemblies available in the NCBI WGS database as of the 15 December 2017. Sequences that produced statistically significant matches to these probes were extracted and classified by BLAST-based comparison to a set of reference peptide sequences selected to represent the broad range of diversity in subfamily <italic>Parvovirinae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Sequence analyses</title><p>Characterization and annotation of EPVs was performed using the Artemis Genome Browser (<xref rid="vey026-B14" ref-type="bibr">Carver et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). Putative peptide sequences encoded by EPVs were inferred and aligned using MUSCLE (<xref rid="vey026-B20" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>), PAL2NAL (<xref rid="vey026-B48" ref-type="bibr">Suyama et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>), and T-coffee Expresso (<xref rid="vey026-B4" ref-type="bibr">Armougom et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). Phylogenies were reconstructed from aa alignments incorporating structural data (at least one high-resolution structure from all available genera), and using maximum likelihood (ML) as implemented in PhyML-3.1, with 1000 bootstrap replicates (<xref rid="vey026-B24" ref-type="bibr">Guindon et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). The RtEV (NS) and the LG (VP) protein substitution models&#x02014;as selected using ProTest (<xref rid="vey026-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abascal et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>)&#x02014;were used for reconstructing phylogenies.</p><p>To detect structural homology, we applied the pGenTHREADER and pDomTHREADER algorithms of the PSIPRED Protein Sequence Analysis Workbench (<xref rid="vey026-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lobley et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>). The selected PDB structures were applied as templates for homology modeling, carried out by SWISS-MODEL (<xref rid="vey026-B8" ref-type="bibr">Biasini et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Polymers of the acquired capsid monomer models were constructed by the Oligomer Generator feature of the Viper web database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://viperdb.scripps.edu/">http://viperdb.scripps.edu/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="vey026-B13" ref-type="bibr">Carrillo-Tripp et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>).

A partial VP ORF could be identified downstream of the NS gene, corresponding to the VP1u and the VP2 N-terminal, as well as nucleotides encoding the last 173 aa of the C-terminus. However, a large part of the ORF is missing due to an assembly gap. A region of VP homology&#x02014;spanning residues 59&#x02013;600&#x02014;could be identified upstream of the NS ORF, encompassed by LINE and SINE elements. Only 60 aa of its derived protein sequence overlap with the downstream, partial VP ORF, indicating that the intervening assembly gap region may correspond to the missing portion of the VP gene.</p><p>Splicing of a putative intron sequence may position three residues of the short, 23-aa-long upstream adjacent ORF in-frame with the VP ORF, consistent with the typical VP1u transcription pattern of amdoparvoviruses (<xref rid="vey026-B42" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). The putative VP ORF encoded by EllLut.1 has a gap relative to the AMDV VP that spans most of the 5&#x02032; region of the gene. Frameshifting mutations are present in the NS genes of both elements, and the VP pseudogenes of EllLut.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>Amdoparvovirus genomes encode a short middle ORF (M-ORF) of unknown function between the two major ORFs (NS and VP) (<xref rid="vey026-B10" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et&#x000a0;al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gottschalck et&#x000a0;al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>, a region of potentially protein-coding sequence that corresponds to the M-ORF of AMDV is present in the EllLut.1 element. A methionine (M) residue that might represent the start codon of an M-ORF gene product could not be identified. However, this is also the case for several exogenous amdoparvovirus isolates (<xref rid="vey026-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gottschalck et&#x000a0;al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>The EllLut.2 element comprises the NS gene alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). This element is integrated into a locus immediately adjacent to the sequences encoding the MAF BZIP transcription factor G (MAFG) gene, which in the mouse genome is located in the 11qE2 region of chromosome 11. The structure of the EllLut.2 element indicates that it was derived from an NS-encoding mRNA that was reverse transcribed and integrated into the nuclear genome of an ancestral germline cell. The otherwise intact NS gene lacks a methionine start codon and 5&#x02032; UTR. However, immediately upstream of the three stop codons disrupting the MAFG gene, a conventional ATG start codon was identified that could provide translation initiation to express a MAFG-NS fusion product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The identification of a potential promoter sequence downstream of the MAFG gene supports the existence of such a fusion protein, as does the strong Kozak translational context of the above mentioned start codon.</p><p>We identified empty integration sites in the <italic>E</italic><italic>llobius</italic><italic>talpinus</italic> genome at the loci where the EllLut.1 and EllLut.2 elements are integrated in <italic>E. lutescens</italic>.

This element, which encoded a nearly complete parvovirus genome, was &#x0223c;4.5&#x02009;kb in length and was integrated in reverse orientation (i.e. preserving the presumed original negative orientation of the virus genome). The putative genome structure comprised two major ORFs and a minor ORF as well as a clearly-identifiable and potentially functional downstream promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Furthermore, two polyadenylation signals could be identified, as well as partial palindromic repeats resembling the amdoparvoviral hairpin structures in the expected positions upstream and downstream of the two ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p>The first major ORF exhibited a relatively high degree of aa identity to the AMDV NS protein (35% with no deletions).

The second major ORF, which was disrupted by several nonsense mutations (two stop codons and two frameshifts), was homologous to VP (36% aa identity with skunk amdoparvovirus VP). This ORF did not possess a conventional Met start codon to express VP1; however, the three aa-long exon leader of a short upstream ORF could potentially provide this, as in other amdoparvoviruses (<xref rid="vey026-B42" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). A putative middle (M) protein ORF was identified between the putative NS and VP genes.</p><p>The polyglycine (poly-G) region in parvovirus VP proteins is suspected to be responsible for externalizing the VP1u (so that the enzymatic functions of the PLA2 domain can be carried out) as well as exposing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the VP1u and the VP2 (<xref rid="vey026-B15" ref-type="bibr">Chapman and Rossmann 1993</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B50" ref-type="bibr">Vihinen-Ranta et&#x000a0;al. 2002</xref>). All exogenous amdoparvovirus VP peptide sequences contain a poly-G, despite lacking a PLA-2 domain. A poly-G region was also present in the predicted VP sequence of ProMuc.1, whereas it was absent from EllLut.1 VP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Interestingly, however, the VP1u sequences of both EPVs disclosed a putative NLS. Notably, the ProMuc.1 VP sequence contained numerous indels relative to those of amdoparvoviruses. Notably, however, indels were almost exclusively confined to the VR loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). The only insertion, six-aa-long, was present in VR VIII. Interestingly, dependoparvovirus-derived EPVs previously identified in marsupial genomes have also been reported to harbor extended VRVII loops (<xref rid="vey026-B47" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>).

Using this approach, the capsids encoded by pit viper and mole vole EPVs proved to be structurally most similar to the canine parvovirus (CPV) capsid (PDB ID: 2CAS) according to fold recognition, hence this structure was used as a template. As there are currently no publicly available structural data for amdoparvorviruses, we constructed the model of the AMDV capsid as well, based on the CPV template.</p><p>The predicted structures of the capsid proteins encoded by the ProMuc.1 and EllLut.1 displayed a rather protoparvovirus-like appearance, unlike the AMDV capsid model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). In the case of ProMuc.1, threefold protrusions were thicker and bulkier than either on CPV or AMDV, while the EllLut.1 capsid model displayed spike-like protrusions rather than the slope-like depressions characteristic of the parvovirus two-/fivefold wall. These differences could be ascribed to insertions in VRs, namely VRVIII of the ProMuc.1 and VRVII of EllLut.1. Both capsids appeared to contain the canonical &#x003b2;-strand A (&#x003b2;A), an eight-stranded &#x003b2;-barrel core making up the jelly roll fold (&#x003b2;BIDG-CHEF), and an &#x003b1;-helix (&#x003b1;A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3b and c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4.

However, while there are eight parvovirus genera currently recognized to infect vertebrates (<xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), almost all the EPVs that have been identified in vertebrate genomes are derived from just two genera: <italic>Dependoparvovirus</italic> and <italic>Protoparvovirus</italic>. EPVs derived from dependoparvoviruses have been identified in several orders of birds and mammals (<xref rid="vey026-B7" ref-type="bibr">Belyi et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B31" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis and Gifford 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B18" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), while EPVs derived from protoparvoviruses have been reported in rodent genomes (<xref rid="vey026-B30" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). Large numbers of &#x02018;protoparvovirus-like&#x02019; EPVs are present in the genomes of mammals, including rodents and marsupials (<xref rid="vey026-B31" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis and Gifford 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B5" ref-type="bibr">Arriagada and Gifford 2014</xref>), but it is less clear whether these derive from <italic>bona fide</italic> protoparvoviruses or a distinct parvovirus lineage (e.g. an extinct genus). Prior to this study, only a single, highly fragmented EPVs (ProCap.1) had been reported as showing homology to amdoparvoviruses (<xref rid="vey026-B31" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis and Gifford 2010</xref>).</p><p>We report the first EPVs that are unambiguously derived from amdoparvoviruses. These two elements, which were identified in the genome of the Transcausian mole vole, were found to group within the diversity of amdoparvovirus isolates in molecular phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). They also exhibit characteristic features that support their grouping within the genus <italic>Amdoparvovirus</italic>, including the presence of a putative M-ORF, and the absence of the PLA2 domain from the predicted VP protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>We did not identify any other EPVs that grouped convincingly within the <italic>Amdoparvovirus</italic> genus. However, we identified several that displayed a mixture of amdoparvoviral and protoparvoviral features. EPVs in this &#x02018;amdo-proto&#x02019; (AP) group&#x02014;which may not be monophyletic (see later)&#x02014;grouped in an intermediate position in phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, while these elements appear to be marginally more closely related to protoparvoviruses than to amdoparvoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), certain aspects of their genome organization suggested an evolutionary connection to amdoparvoviruses. For example, in the pit viper element, these include: (1) the presence of a single promoter and two polyadenylation signals; (2) the attributes of the intron in the VP1u; and (3) the apparent absence of a PLA2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>We were able to infer maximum age bounds of 54 million years for the pit viper EPV and 10 million years for the mole vole EPVs, based on the identification of empty integration sites in related species. However, none of the EPVs reported here were identified as orthologous copies in two or more related species. Consequently, we are unable to draw firm conclusions with respect to their minimum ages. The mutational degradation observed in the more fragmented elements suggests they are likely to have similarly ancient origins to other EPVs (i.e. extending back millions of years). In the case of the mole vole, two EllLut.2 alleles were present (one containing a deletion relative to the other), indicating that these elements have likely been present in the species gene pool for multiple generations.</p><p>The confirmed host range of amdoparvoviruses is restricted to carnivores, but this likely reflects limited sampling&#x02014;metagenomic studies of parvovirus diversity are providing strong hints that most if not all genera in the subfamily <italic>Parvovirinae</italic> are likely to have representatives that infect all most if not all extant mammalian orders (<xref rid="vey026-B19" ref-type="bibr">de Souza et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, the identification of amdoparvovirus-derived EPVs in the genome of the Transcaucasian mole vole advances our current knowledge by uneqivocally demonstrating that amdoparvoviruses have infected rodents in the past. The pit viper element reported here (ProMuc.1) is the first EPV to be identified in a reptile genome.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Evolution of amdoparvovirus and protoparvovirus capsid proteins</title><p>Comparison of predicted VP protein structures to those of exogenous amdoparvoviruses revealed that most differences are limited to regions of conspicuous functional significance, including the PLA2 domain, VP1u, and the VR loops that are exposed on the virion surface and are thought to be involved in mediating many host-virus interactions, such as immunogenicity and receptor attachment (<xref rid="vey026-B27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). The fact that variation is overwhelmingly confined to these regions suggests it largely reflects diversity accumulated through selection on ancestral viruses, rather than mutations acquired postintegration. The strikingly high level of deletions seen in the VR regions of the ProMuc.1 VP protein is consistent with this, since we might expect that the reptilian anti-viral response, in which the adaptive immune system plays a relatively small role, would exert selective pressures that were somewhat different to those encountered by parvoviruses infecting mammals (<xref rid="vey026-B54" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). A similar idea has previously been proposed to explain the characteristically smooth surface features, i.e. shorter or absent VRs, of invertebrate-infecting densoviruses (<xref rid="vey026-B46" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>Uniquely, amdoparvoviruses lack a PLA2 domain in their VP1u region (<xref rid="vey026-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cotmore, 2014</xref>, p. 22). Most parvoviruses require this highly conserved motif for escape from the endosomal compartments after entering the host cell (<xref rid="vey026-B52" ref-type="bibr">Zadori et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>), and consequently amdoparvoviral trafficking is not fully understood. EPVs in the AP lineage are presumably derived from an uncharacterized parvovirus lineage possessing amdoparvovirus and protoparvovirus-like features. However, the lack of phylogenetic resolution between the three main clades, and the fragmentary genome structures of most elements in the AP lineage, limits what we can infer about them. They might derive from viruses representing transitional forms along a pathway from protoparvovirus-like complete PLA2 domains to an amdoparvovirus-like PLA2-absent state. However, they could also represent an entirely distinct lineage that diverged from a common ancestor shared with contemporary amdo- and protoparvoviruses. In fact, since the pit viper element only groups weakly with other AP elements in phylogenetic trees, the AP clade shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> may not in fact be truly monophyletic, and might instead represent entirely distinct mammalian and reptilian lineages.</p><p>Interestingly, an intact calcium binding loop was found in the predicted VP1u protein sequences of all EPVs in the AP lineage that encoded this region, even though most of these sequences also have a degraded PLA2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This observation raises the possibility that this loop might have functions in the viral life cycle that are unrelated to its role in phospholipase-mediated escape from the endosomal compartments.</p><p>We used homology modeling to infer the structures of the capsid (VP) proteins encoded by EPVs. This analysis revealed that both EilLut.1 and ProMuc.1 capsids had a protoparvovirus-like appearance, rather than being similar to the AMDV capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). These findings are intriguing when considered in the light of the phylogenetic relationships depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>. Results based on homology modeling should of course be interpreted cautiously, but these observations could reflect that the ancestral viruses that gave rise to these two elements were more similar to protoparvoviruses than amdoparvoviruses in certain aspects of their biology related to their capsid proteins (e.g. tropism or receptor specificity). With regard to this, the prominent role of Fc-receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in AMDV infection should be considered (<xref rid="vey026-B51" ref-type="bibr">von Kietzell et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Residues 428&#x02013;446 in VP have been shown to play an important role in mediating Fc-receptor attachment during ADE, and interestingly this region overlaps with VR VII, which is highly divergent in both ProMuc.1 and EllLut.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey026-F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). It is not known whether ADE plays an important role in infections with amdoparvoviruses other than AMDV, or whether the variability observed in this region is relevant to this process, but it is nonetheless intriguing to consider that the distinctive appearance of the AMDV capsid might be related to its use of ADE as an entry mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>4.3 Intact, potentially expressible NS genes encoded by EPVs reported here</title><p>Two of the EPVs described here (EilLut.2 and ProMuc.1) encode intact, expressible NS genes, adding to a growing number of EPVs that exhibit this characteristic (<xref rid="vey026-B31" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis and Gifford 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B36" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vey026-B5" ref-type="bibr">Arriagada and Gifford 2014</xref>).
