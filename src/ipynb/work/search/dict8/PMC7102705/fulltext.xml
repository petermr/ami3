The current unprecedented Zika viral epidemics and rapid spread in the Western hemisphere pose a substantial global threat, with associated anxiety and consequences. The lack of safe and effective drugs and vaccines against Zika or dengue epidemics further buttresses the realization from the West Africa Ebola outbreak that most emerging disease-prone countries are still poorly prepared for an emergency response.

Both Zika and dengue infections appear to have similar early signs and symptoms including maculo-papular rash, fever, back/body pain; they differ in their late stage or complication symptoms, such as hemorrhagic bleeding in dengue. Previous dengue epidemics have been documented but less virulent and localized than the ongoing widespread ZIKV epidemics. Nevertheless, there is still much to be learned regarding the full human impact of ZIKV compared to the pathophysiological and immunological consequences of dengue virus. ZIKV can be transmitted to humans by infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito bites, infected mother-to-child trans-placenta bodily fluid diffusion, blood transfusion, unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected individual and perhaps breastfeeding. More short and long-term operational research is needed to further establish the risk factors and determinants and to confirm the association between Zika virus infections, microcephaly and related neurological aberrations suspected in fetal and childhood development (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>

Currently, only palliative treatments including anti-inflammatory and antiviral treatment options are readily available for patient management.</p><p id="par0050">Enhancing community-based social mobilization and engagement, awareness campaigns and outreach, vigilance and monitoring of early warning signals fosters health system capacity development (e.g., infrastructure and human resources) and community partnerships and leadership. In addition, effective community resilience and empowerment, prevention and care management and containment emergency responses across endemic or epidemic prone countries are vital. Adequate training of healthcare workers is needed to effectively carry out effective and efficient communication operations as well as community literacy, prevention, care and containment (e.g., patient isolation) and management approaches.</p><p id="par0055">The differential diagnosis of ZIKV and DENV mosquito-borne illnesses by health workers or local physicians can be very challenging because of the similarities in signs and symptoms. Molecular diagnostic assay results from sophisticated and differential medical interpretations (e.g., ultrasonography, MRI, RT PCR assay) are not often available and accessible and are also expensive for vulnerable populations in remote rural and semi-urban settings. Other alternative solutions include providing advocacy and mitigation platforms against climate changes, urbanization and globalization approaches to reducing mother-to-child transmission, comprehensive antenatal and postnatal programs for women, sexual education and use of protective tools and measures, adherence and quality outcomes. Containing the current public health scourge of ZIKV and DENV diseases will require the integration of population-based mass drug administration and immunization interventions supported by robust evidence-based and integrated epidemiological, socio-cultural, climatic and environmental surveillance and information management to guide decision-making policy and rapid responses. Nevertheless, implementation of real time, contextual and practical laws and regulations focusing on positive social behavioral attitudes and perceptions is needed to strengthen health systems, nurture safe motherhood and childhood practices and foster evidence-driven community project ownership to accelerate recovery programs and activities in affected communities.</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><title>Strengthening vector-borne disease preparedness and surveillance&#x02013;response in maternal and neonatal child health</title><p id="par0060">Weak or lack of health system preparedness and emergency response, lack or inadequacies in early detection and diagnostics, lack of surveillance indicators and benchmarks, lack of tracing and tracking and lack of effective risk communication and reporting tools and resources in Zika and other emerging infectious diseases are major challenges in most affected countries. The poor accessibility and availability of care services to most vulnerable populations during Zika epidemics increase maternal&#x02013;child vulnerability in remote rural settings. Improving the health system capacity to respond to maternal and neonatal health challenges can be accomplished by timely, credible and actionable data inputs, coverage and the quality of services provided.

ZIKV rates might be underestimated and could even be higher because confusion with other diseases with similar symptoms could be misleading due to acquired immunity to other tropical infections in ZIKV human reservoirs, which might also complicate the actual Zika cases. ZIKV transmission in human reservoirs can be interrupted with DEET/permethrin clothing repellents as Zika prevention and control methods.</p><p id="par0065">Evidence-based interventions and support programming can be provided by strengthening local and national preparedness as well as surveillance&#x02013;response system implementation in maternal, neonatal and child health. Accelerating the process of local/national ZIKV and DENV immunization is critical and should be included in family and reproductive health planning, nutrition and poverty alleviation programs, programs and services linking communities and primary health facilities and referral hospitals. Moreover, effective and sustainable programs and measures are crucial to increase access and coverage rates to reduce health inequities, poverty and the maternal&#x02013;child health burden in most emerging infectious disease epidemic-prone countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0050"><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0070">Zika and dengue viral diseases have posed great challenges to the most affected countries, mainly in terms of maternal&#x02013;child health impact.

Because most African countries have limited surveillance indicators to assess the threat of re-emergence, early warning disease alerts, community awareness outreach and education are essential. Both Zika and dengue are spread in a similar way, via body fluids, and they currently do not have an effective antiretroviral cure <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Therefore, strengthening community health systems and fostering effective prevention and care delivery capacity are paramount.

Implementation of effective and sustainable interventions such as community social engagement and participation outreach, prompt identification and case management, surveillance and preparedness systems, contact tracing, laboratory diagnosis, community mobilization, recovery systems for survivors, safe burial practices and behavioral changes (e.g., promotion of condom usage. abstinence, antenatal counseling) among ZIKV victims offer new opportunities to eliminate ZIKV, other sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) and dengue in the Western hemisphere, Pacific islands and some parts of sub-Saharan Africa <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Maternal perinatal education and increasing household income in affected communities can have a significant impact in reducing child deaths and maternal vulnerability. Moreover, there is an emerging resurgence of dengue patterns and trend in poor countries and the Americas, likely related to climate changes, global warming and intense environmental perturbations.

Tackling emerging or re-emerging vector-borne viral disease requires more proactive and concrete efforts and commitment in terms of climate changes and environmental protection, mitigation and appropriate adaptation measure development and deployment to address the growing trends.

As indicated in early arbovirus research, most healthcare workers and blood-transfused patients might be infected with Zika or dengue because of a lack of proper diagnostic capacities, poor elucidation of the routes of transmission, pathogenesis and spread. A similar effect was observed among dengue or ZIKV-infected health workers during the early history of the disease. In addition, lessons learned from the global dengue response should be extended to ZIKV in a timely manner <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.
