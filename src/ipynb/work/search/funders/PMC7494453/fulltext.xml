The many risks to the wellbeing of HCWs are not well understood. Of the literature, there is a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWs&#x02019; wellbeing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was used to investigate the psychological impact on HCWs facing epidemics or pandemics, using three electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL), dating back to 2002 until the 21st of August 2020. The search strategy included terms for HCWs (e.g., nurse and doctor), mental health (e.g., wellbeing and psychological), and viral outbreaks (e.g., epidemic and pandemic). Only studies with greater than 100 frontline HCWs (i.e. doctors or nurses in close proximity to infected patients) were included.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 55 studies were included, with 53 using quantitative methodology and 2 were qualitative. 50 of the quantitative studies used validated measurement tools while 5 used novel questionnaires. The studies were conducted across various countries and included people with SARS (13 studies), Ebola (1), MERS (3) and COVID-19 (38). Findings suggest that the psychological implications to HCWs are variable with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring trauma or stress-related disorders, depression and anxiety. Fear of the unknown or becoming infected were at the forefront of the mental challenges faced. Being a nurse and being female appeared to confer greater risk. The perceived stigma from family members and society heightened negative implications; predominantly stress and isolation. Coping strategies varied amongst the contrasting sociocultural settings and appeared to differ amongst doctors, nurses and other HCWs. Implemented changes, and suggestions for prevention in the future consistently highlighted the need for greater psychosocial support and clearer dissemination of disease-related information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This review can inform current and future research priorities in the maintenance of wellbeing amongst frontline HCWs. Change needs to start at the level of policy-makers to offer an enhanced variety of supports to HCWs who play a critical role during largescale disease outbreaks. Psychological implications are largely negative and require greater attention to be mitigated, potentially through the involvement of psychologists, raised awareness and better education. The current knowledge of therapeutic interventions suggests they could be beneficial but more long-term follow-up is needed.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Frontline health care workers (HCWs), especially females and nurses, are amongst the most vulnerable groups at risk of mental health problems, especially during severe viral epidemics.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Fear of uncertainty or becoming infected were at the forefront of the psychological challenges faced.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Several studies demonstrated an increased risk of acquiring trauma or stress-related disorders, depression and anxiety.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Coping strategies varied between sociocultural settings and HCWs of different disciplines.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Adequate psychosocial support and clear dissemination of disease-related information was consistently recommended.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Epidemic</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Psychological impact</kwd><kwd>SARS</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Large-scale disease epidemics pose various challenges to individuals of all ages and cultures but the emotional stress experienced by frontline health care workers (HCWs) is severe, and can be enduring (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tam et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Maunder et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lancee et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan, China, led to a pandemic unlike any other in the last century. The subsequent demand placed on HCWs is difficult to encompass in its entirety. Even less is known about the implications for their mental health and well-being. Evidence from studies during COVID-19 and similar past epidemics can help inform this, and how best to address it.</p><p id="p0040">A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease, otherwise known as an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents. (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Emergencies preparedness,</xref>) The world has faced several such bio-disasters including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, parts of Asia and Canada in 2003, Ebola in West Africa in 2014 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2016. The most recent epidemic of COVID-19 led to an alarmingly high global death toll, with thousands of HCWs becoming infected (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baud et&#x000a0;al.</xref>). The fast changing response to this novel virus was likely to have had a profound effect on the wellbeing of hospital employees working on the front-line. Furthermore, the rapid transmission rate of COVID-19 led to unparalleled tasks that HCWs may not have been adequately equipped to deal with, from both a professional and psychological viewpoint.</p><p id="p0045">Dealing with a severe global health disaster is an uncharted journey into the unknown at various levels. Government bodies make plans using other countries&#x02019; data to project infection rates. The high degree of uncertainty associated to novel pathogens further contributes to the communal anxiety held, and makes for an overall negative experience for most. However, the challenge encountered can also result in positive changes, as individuals harness their coping skills, work together in teams, and the change instrumented by leaders can strengthen nations&#x02019; preparedness against future disasters.</p><p id="p0050">In terms of mental health impact of epidemics, HCWs represent a particularly vulnerable group due to the high risk of infection, increased work stress and fear of spreading to their families (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">During the recent Ebola outbreak, an unprecedented number of HCWs were infected (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Unprecedented number of m, 2014</xref>) and survivors of infectious diseases have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hong et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Recommendations around the use of psychological first aid (PFA) have been made by global authorities (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Psychological first aid d, 2014</xref>). However, the efficacy of this strategy is not well studied and barriers to its application exist (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Workforce development at, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Birkhead and Vermeulen, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">The many risks to the wellbeing of HCWs are not well understood.

Detrimental outcomes such as burnout, traumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been reported even after an outbreak, suggesting long-term implications (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lancee et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Given the likely increased rate of psychological problems amongst HCWs, these factors must be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Purpose of this review</title><p id="p0065">In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this timely review is both relevant and urgent. It is imperative that those working at the frontline with infected patients or in afflicted regions have the necessary strategies and resources to endure various challenges. There is a lack of systematic reviews published specifically on the mental health implications experienced by frontline HCWs during an epidemic. Of the literature, there is also a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWs&#x02019; wellbeing. The purpose of this review is to explore the main findings from the literature examining the psychological impact on HCWs in times of severe epidemics, and to identify strategies to address this.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Search strategy and selection criteria</title><p id="p0070">We performed a systematic literature review to identify all international research related to epidemics and pandemics.

As the clear majority of papers used self-reported measures, to ensure inclusion of high quality and adequately powered research, studies needed to include at least 100 frontline HCWs. HCWs needed to be working in close proximity with infected patients. The initial search yielded 2,876 papers, of which 55 included relevant data and were included in this review.

Interestingly, one study (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chan et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) of 1,470 nurses, showed that nurses in moderate-risk areas appeared to have more stress symptoms than those working in high-risk areas, but the reasons for this remain unclear.

Further, 27% of participants (177 of 660) had psychiatric symptoms, with the doctors being 1.6 times more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms than nurses, and 20% (127 of 651) had PTSD. In contrast, a study (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lung et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) comparing 127 HCWs impacted by SARS, found no significant difference in feelings of stress between the physicians, nurses and other HCWs. An Italian study (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) of 1,379 HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, showed that general practitioners were more likely to have PTSS than other HCWs, while nurses and health care assistants were more likely to exhibit severe insomnia. Similarly, another Chinese study (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2020c</xref>) found that nurses (234) working in the frontline against COVID-19 experienced significantly greater levels of vicarious traumatisation when compared to non-frontline nurses (292).

The entire experience can be traumatising and heighten the risk of mental health conditions in a group that are already at increased risk, for instance HCWs are at higher risk of suicide than the general population (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dutheil et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that the psychological effects of epidemics on HCWs are variable across different contexts with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring a trauma or stress-related disorder. The risk to the mental well-being of HCWs are likely to be multi-faceted and more research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that can potentially be mitigated with appropriate measures. Collection of high quality data is urgently needed, especially for vulnerable groups exposed to a pandemic (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et&#x000a0;al.</xref>). Interventions to reduce morbidity and severity of psychological problems in HCWs in the early stage may prevent adverse short-term and long-term implications.</p><p id="p0215">It is important to note that professional recognition and ethics can positively reinforce hard work but the value of these are diminished when they are applied in a punitive way that stereotypes HCWs. The emphasis on their self-sacrifice while providing essential and life-saving services becomes magnified in the midst of an epidemic and often HCWs are portrayed as heroes. This in turn can impose certain expectations on them, to demonstrate personal strength and resilience, both emotionally and professionally. However, this can also impede their ability to recognise vulnerabilities or share traumatic experiences, similar in some aspects to military personnel. This may inadvertently increase their mental health risks and stigmatising beliefs, thus prevent them from seeking psychological help (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). As such, HCWs must feel free to express their emotions and share experiences, both positive and negative, even when society portrays them as faceless masked agents, and hails them as heroes.</p><p id="p0220">By acknowledging the positive dimensions of any global heath disaster, it is pertinent to understand factors that can build greater resilience among HCWs, either working as individuals or in groups. Of HCWs in the SARS epidemic, 82% reported feeling appreciated by their employer and 77% by society (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Koh et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). HCWs felt that they were more devoted to helping others, having survived the disaster (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tam et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Professional and ethical values were identified as predominant motivators driving HCWs to fulfil their duties during the MERS epidemic (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Khalid et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). It is thus necessary and pressing to study systematically the resilience factors that can promote the mental well-being of HCWs at the psychological, professional, workplace and societal levels.</p><p id="p0225">To enhance recovery and wellbeing, a range of psychological measures to address the mental health challenges during previous epidemics has been reported, especially through moderation of stress levels, education and workplace supports. Strategies can be adapted to local contexts, variable conditions, and be scaled up or down depending on the needs of HCWs over time. PFA can provide support to survivors following a serious crisis event, as it reduces the initial distress of the traumatic event by enhancing adaptive functioning and coping in the face of extraordinary stress (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pekevski, 2013</xref>). However, this is simply not enough in responding to a pandemic such as COVID-19. An element of preparedness must also be considered to approach the under-recognised mental health problems in a more proactive way. Furthermore, even in the recovery phase of an epidemic, there is a clear need for consistent and long-term support to promote and protect the well-being of HCWs.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0230">Managing the emerging mental health issues amongst HCWs during an epidemic is imperative particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The potential psychological consequences faced by this highly vulnerable group can have profound and long-term implications. While some elements of tackling an epidemic are difficult to modify, many preventable aspects can be considered. Fear can be minimised through the correct dissemination of information and the provision of adequate training and resources. Education to HCWs, their families and the wider public can help lessen stigma and discrimination. Hospital and health policy-makers must also consider the importance of a preventative approach to mitigate the development of psychological manifestations. Psychosocial support and effective measures need to be readily available in multiple modalities and levels, and designed to suit the specific characteristics of HCWs to empower them in the critical role they play against epidemics. Further high-quality and longitudinal research is needed especially on measures to reduce their mental health burden should be a priority.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Author statement</title><p id="p0235">Sonja Cabarkapa: Responsible for writing the manuscript, data extraction, corresponding author &#x02013; approval of the manuscript.
