    "INTRODUCTION:Every winter, emergency departments (EDs) face overcrowding with patients presenting influenza-like symptoms, and organisational issues such as single room assignment and droplet precautions to avoid hospital-acquired influenza. Our main objective was to assess the impact of PCR results and patient's severity on single room assignment. METHODS:All patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital through the ED and tested for influenza by PCR (GenXpert, Cepheid) or (FilmArray, BioMérieux) on a nasopharyngeal swab were retrospectively included during three influenza seasons (2015-2018. RESULTS:Of 1,330 included patients, 278 (20.9%) had a positive PCR for influenza. The median time to obtain a PCR result was 19 hours, and 238 (18.3%) patients were assigned a single room. Among patients with positive and negative influenza PCR, 22.3% and 16.7% were assigned a single room (p = 0.03). The multivariable analysis was performed on the two first epidemic periods, excluding the third epidemic because of the concomitant use of influenza immune-chromatic test. Only level 1 of the Emergency severity index (ESI) (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8; p < 0.01) was associated with single-room assignment. PCR result was not statistically associated with the decision of single room assignment (aOR, 1.4; 95%CI, 1.0-1.4; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION:A PCR positive for influenza was not significantly associated with single-room assignment. Less than one quarter of influenza patients were adequately assigned a single room, likely due to the long turnaround time of PCR result and other conflicting indications for single room-assignment. Accelerating biological diagnosis could improve single-room assignment."
