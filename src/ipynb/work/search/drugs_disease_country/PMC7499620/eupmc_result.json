    "To suppress the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has implemented a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Because COVID-19 and influenza have similar means of transmission, it is hypothesized that NPIs targeting COVID-19 may also affect influenza transmission. In this study, the extent to which NPIs targeting COVID-19 have affected seasonal influenza transmission was explored. Indicators of seasonal influenza activity in the epidemiological year 2019/20 were compared with those in 2017/18 and 2018/19. Results show that the incidence rate of seasonal influenza reduced by 64% in 2019/20 (p&0.001). These findings suggest that NPIs aimed at controlling COVID-19 significantly reduced the seasonal influenza transmission in China. (105 words)."
