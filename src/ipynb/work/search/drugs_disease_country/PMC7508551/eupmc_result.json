    "The global risks report of 2020 stated, climate-related issues dominate all of the top-five long-term critical global risks burning the planet and according to the report, “as existing health risks resurge and new ones emerge, humanity's past successes in overcoming health challenges are no guarantee of future results.” Over the last few decades, the world has experienced several pandemic outbreaks of various pathogens and the frequency of the emergence of novel strains of infectious organisms has increased in recent decades. As per expert opinion, rapidly mutating viruses, emergence and re-emergence of epidemics with increasing frequencies, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are likely to be increasing over the years and the trends will continue and intensify. Susceptible disease hosts, anthropogenic activities and environmental changes contribute and trigger the ‘adaptive evolution’ of infectious agents to thrive and spread into different ecological niches and to adapt to new hosts. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide insight into the human actions which should be strictly regulated to help to sustain life on earth. To identify and categorize the triggering factors that contribute to disease ecology, especially repeated emergence of disease pandemics, a theory building approach, ‘Total Interpretive Structural Modeling’ (TISM) was used; also the tool, ‘Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification’ analysis (MICMAC) was applied to rank the risk factors based on their impacts on other factors and on the interdependence among them. This mathematical modeling tool clearly explains the strength, position and interconnectedness of each anthropogenic factor that contributes to the evolution of pathogens and to the frequent emergence of pandemics which needs to be addressed with immediate priority. As we are least prepared for another pandemic outbreak, significant policy attention must be focused on the causative factors to limit emerging outbreaks like COVID 19 in the future. Graphical abstract Fig. 1. Graphical abstract showing the common pathways of pathogen evolution in pandemic outbreaksSeveral factors contribute to the adaptive evolution of infectious agents to spread into different ecological niches, adapt to new hosts, escape from host defense mechanisms and spread globally. They are broadly categorized in three major factors; host factors, microbial factors and environmental factors (Figure 1). Rapid genetic mutation is an adaptation for pathogen evolution and emergence. Viral genetic recombination or re-assortment is another factor contributing their degree of virulence. The co-infection by closely related viral species in the same host cell can have a role in the emergence of new virus strains by re-assortment. Environmental factors like changes in climate, habitat etc along with host factors can also trigger changes in reservoir host populations or intermediate vectors which can contribute to pathogen evolution and emergence of epidemics or pandemics.Image 1"
