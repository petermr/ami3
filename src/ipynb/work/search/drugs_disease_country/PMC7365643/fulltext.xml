These principles are proposed for endorsement by research funders, donors, governments or any other entities supporting research to address the most pressing global needs around COVID-19 and for future epidemics and pandemics. They aim to improve relevant research outputs, ensure outputs are shared rapidly to permit consolidation and review, inform policy and practice, and ensure lessons are learned to improve responses within this pandemic and for future epidemics and pandemics.<boxed-text id="box1"><label>Panel</label><caption><title>Funder principles for supporting high-quality research for the most pressing global needs in epidemics and pandemics</title></caption><p id="para10">The principles aim to address good practice in relation to:</p><p id="para20">

They provide a basis for guiding both funder and researcher expectations for COVID-19 and for future epidemics and pandemics. The principles are globally applicable, but of particular importance for research in lower resourced settings.</p><p id="para130">Given the urgency, scale and resource limitations, there is a particular risk that research needs in resource-limited countries are not adequately addressed for the COVID-19 pandemic, that research outputs fail to inform real-time policy in these settings, and that capacity is not sustained to address future outbreaks. The research community has already taken steps to respond to this challenge through the creation of the global coalition to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research in resource-limited settings.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Global research funders are now launching further <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.glopid-r.org/funding-opportunities/" id="interrefs20">calls</ext-link> to support research in low-income and middle-income countries for COVID-19.</p><p id="para140">The UKCDR and GloPID-R funder groups have agreed to align to further strengthen their response with the formation of a new jointly hosted initiative for COVID-19 research coordination and learning (COVID-CIRCLE) in accordance with these principles, with a particular focus on resource limited settings.
