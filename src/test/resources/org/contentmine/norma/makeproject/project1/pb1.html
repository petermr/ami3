This article aims to evaluate the recent changes and relate them to current conservation ethics.  Observations were made on site, derived from research in published literature and were assessed accord-ing to principles of conservation. The article concludes that, in the recent developments, conservation  ethics have been drawn upon in an inconsistent fashion, and that the best description for the rebirth  of the station is &#8216;recycling&#8217;. Investigation of the &#8216;conservation&#8217; of significant items of national heritage,  like St Pancras, is essential for formulating future standards and evaluating our own perceptions and the  diversity of possible interpretations of conservation terminology. <div><img src="../../../target/output/63-684-1-PB-1/image.g.1.6.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/63-684-1-PB-1/image.g.1.6.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><div><img src="../../../target/output/63-684-1-PB-1/image.g.1.7.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/63-684-1-PB-1/image.g.1.7.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>Art.&#8201;1, page&#8201;2 of 21  Allington-Jones: The Phoenix <div><img src="../../../target/output/63-684-1-PB-1/image.g.2.2.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/63-684-1-PB-1/image.g.2.2.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><p/><b>Fig. 1:</b>  Eastern elevation.  1970s  it  was  recognised  as  unobtainable.
