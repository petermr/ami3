This array of sequences presents new opportunities to perform comparative analyses. In comparative studies, it is often useful to compare across wide phylogenetic spans and, within angiosperms, to include representatives from basally diverging lineages such as the genomes reported here: <italic>Nuphar advena </italic>(from a basal-most lineage) and <italic>Ranunculus macranthus </italic>(a basal eudicot). We report these two new plastid genome sequences and make comparisons (within angiosperms, seed plants, or all photosynthetic lineages) to evaluate features such as the status of <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>as protein coding genes, the distribution of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and longer dispersed repeats (SDR), and patterns of nucleotide composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>Nuphar </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_008788">NC_008788</ext-link>] and <italic>Ranunculus </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_008796">NC_008796</ext-link>] plastid genomes share characteristics of gene content and organization with many other chloroplast genomes. Like other plastid genomes, these genomes are A+T-rich, except for rRNA and tRNA genes. Detailed comparisons of <italic>Nuphar </italic>with <italic>Nymphaea</italic>, another Nymphaeaceae, show that more than two-thirds of these genomes exhibit at least 95% sequence identity and that most SSRs are shared. In broader comparisons, SSRs vary among genomes in terms of abundance and length and most contain repeat motifs based on A and T nucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SSR and SDR abundance varies by genome and, for SSRs, is proportional to genome size. Long SDRs are rare in the genomes assessed. SSRs occur less frequently than predicted and, although the majority of the repeat motifs do include A and T nucleotides, the A+T bias in SSRs is less than that predicted from the underlying genomic nucleotide composition. In codon usage third positions show an A+T bias, however variation in codon usage does not correlate with differences in A+T-richness. Thus, although plastome nucleotide composition shows "A+T richness", an A+T bias is not apparent upon more in-depth analysis, at least in these aspects. The pattern of evolution in the sequences identified as <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>is not consistent with them being protein-coding genes. In fact, these regions show no evidence of sequence conservation beyond what is normal for non-coding regions of the IR.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In this paper we report the complete chloroplast genome sequences of the angiosperms <italic>Nuphar advena </italic>(Nymphaeaceae) and <italic>Ranunculus macranthus </italic>(Ranunculaceae). The Nymphaeaceae is placed very near or even at the base of extant angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], whereas the <italic>Ranunculus </italic>chloroplast genome represents the basal-most eudicot characterized to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus we add to the small number of genomes not representing monocots or crown eudicots, increasing our ability to compare genomes across all angiosperms and determine general characteristics. Most chloroplast genomes in angiosperms (reviewed in: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) range from 135 to 160 kb and exist, at least in part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as single genome circles. In the majority of angiosperm chloroplast genomes two copies of a large inverted repeat (IR) of about 25 kb separate the remainder of the genome into two regions of unique DNA, the large (about 90 kb) and small (about 20 kb) single copy regions (LSC and SSC, respectively). Tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>), the first completely sequenced chloroplast genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], is most frequently used to contrast features of newly studied angiosperm cpDNAs and is parsimoniously inferred to represent the ancestral (or at least consensus) angiosperm chloroplast genome in terms of gene content and organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This is reinforced by the similarity of the tobacco cpDNA to the basal angiosperms, <italic>Amborella </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>Nymphaea </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the magnolids, <italic>Calycanthus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]<italic>Drimys, Liriodendron</italic>, and <italic>Piper </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In some derived angiosperm lineages, this ancestral condition has been somewhat or highly modified via inversions, gene losses, presence or absence of ORFs and minor ycfs, and changes in IR extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the tobacco-like pattern is widely distributed in crown eudicots, e.g., <italic>Panax </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], <italic>Eucalyptus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and <italic>Gossypium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Comparative chloroplast genomics as well as detailed characterizations of individual chloroplast genomes serve as the basis for functional genomic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and can direct attempts at chloroplast transformation for genetic engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition the chloroplast genome is an important source of genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis, population-level studies, genotyping and mapping that can be further exploited with additional genomic characterization and comparison. Detailed comparisons of genomic sequence have the potential, for example, to identify functional sequence outside of coding regions (promoters, terminators, replication origins, etc.), test the reality of hypothetical protein coding regions, make inferences about mutational rates and mechanisms, and detect selective signatures in gene sequences. Many fundamental aspects of the chloroplast genome are poorly understood and incompletely described. Here we use genomic comparisons to investigate the likelihood that <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>are not protein-coding genes, the occurrence of microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), the presence of somewhat larger more complex repeats or small disperse repeats (SDR) and how nucleotide composition contributes to patterns of genome organization such as codon usage and repeat structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Genomic characteristics, including IR extent</title><p>Both the <italic>Nuphar </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_008788">NC_008788</ext-link>] and <italic>Ranunculus </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_008796">NC_008796</ext-link>] genomes exhibit the quadripartite structure common to most land plant genomes with large and small single copy regions (LSC and SSC, respectively) separated by two copies of the IR. The <italic>Nuphar </italic>chloroplast genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is 160,866 bp in total length; the LSC is 90,379 bp, the SSC 18,817 bp and the two IR copies each 25,835 bp in length. In <italic>Ranunculus </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the overall length is 155,129 bp with a LSC of 84,638 bp, a SSC of 18,909 bp, and two IR regions each of 25,791 bp. As is common to chloroplast genomes in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the nucleotide composition of both of these genomes are biased towards A and T nucleotides, i.e., they are "A+T-rich". Overall the <italic>Nuphar </italic>genome is 60.9% A+T and <italic>Ranunculus </italic>62.1% A+T. Different regions of the genome vary in A+T content, but all partitions are A+T rich with the exception of the two classes of RNA genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Linearized <italic>Nuphar advena </italic>plastome map.

All random reads generated from the two IR regions falsely assemble in one location, but presumably about half of the reads are sequenced from one copy of the repeat and half from the other. If the two copies varied in sequence, one would expect, on average, half the reads to reflect one variant and half the other, but all reads that assembled into this region for both <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunculus </italic>were identical in sequence. In fact, throughout the entire cpDNA of <italic>Nuphar</italic>, only one case of potential heteroplasmy was observed, where four reads indicated a run of 10 As and four others indicated 11. In <italic>Ranunculus </italic>no cases of high quality mismatch involving more than a single read were detected, even though multiple individuals contributed to the sequencing template. Nucleotide polymorphisms in chloroplast DNA sequences have been detected in several other groups. In the completely sequenced <italic>Pelargonium </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], 11 polymorphisms were detected and nine of these were located in the LSC. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine if the differences in <italic>Nuphar </italic>or <italic>Pelargonium </italic>represent heteroplasmy because multiple individuals were used in both studies. Heteroplasmy in the chloroplast genome has been detected in several other groups, including rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], <italic>Medicago </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and <italic>Senecio </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The IR extent in <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunculus</italic>, as well as those of the basal angiosperms sequenced by Goremykin et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], were confirmed independently of the primary sequencing effort by PCR amplification and sequencing of the boundary regions. Although all these genomes contain IRs similar in extent to those of <italic>Nicotiana </italic>and many other angiosperms, some minor modifications were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As is common among angiosperms, a complete copy of <italic>ycf1 </italic>spans the SSC/IR<sub>A </sub>junction and the 5'end of the gene is duplicated at the SSC end of IRb. Among the comparisons shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the amount of <italic>ycf1 </italic>that is duplicated ranges from 156 bp in <italic>Nymphaea </italic>to 1,583 bp in <italic>Amborella</italic>. At the LSC end of the IR, there is variation in these taxa over whether and how much of the gene <italic>trnH </italic>is duplicated. No part of <italic>trnH </italic>is duplicated in <italic>Calycanthus </italic>or <italic>Nicotiana </italic>but amounts ranging from one bp in <italic>Nymphaea </italic>to the entire gene (plus 140 bp of IGS) in <italic>Nuphar </italic>have been incorporated into the IR. The <italic>trnH </italic>gene has also been incorporated in the IR of <italic>Drimys </italic>but not in the other two recently sequenced magnoliid genomes, <italic>Liriodendron</italic>, and <italic>Piper </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Large or complex changes in the extent of the IR should make distinctive markers of evolutionary lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, given the small size of the changes discussed here and the relative ease of small (~100 bp) movements of the IR boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the amount of <italic>ycf1 </italic>duplicated and the migration of <italic>trnH </italic>relative to the IR would not make very reliable phylogenetic markers.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of inverted repeat-single copy boundaries in six representative angiosperms.

Seventy-nine different protein-coding genes (including, in this count, four hypothetical genes, <italic>ycf1</italic>, <italic>ycf2</italic>, <italic>ycf3</italic>, and <italic>ycf4</italic>), four rRNA genes and 30 tRNA genes occur in these genomes. Eighteen of these genes contain introns including two genes, <italic>clpP </italic>and <italic>ycf3</italic>, each with two introns, and one gene, <italic>rps12</italic>, also composed of three exons, but with the 5' exon separated from the two 3' exons. These features are common characteristics of land plant chloroplast genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The hypothetical gene <italic>ycf15 </italic>was first identified as ORF87 in <italic>Nicotiana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and has been included in the annotation of a subset of the completed land plant genomes. However, the validity of <italic>ycf15 </italic>as a protein-coding gene has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Schmitz-Linneweber et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] found that the plastomes of <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, <italic>Epifagus </italic>and <italic>Cuscuta </italic>contain intact copies of <italic>ycf15</italic>, whereas those of <italic>Spinacia </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>contain <italic>ycf15 </italic>as two pieces, with the 5' and 3' sections separated by 250&#x02013;300 bp of 'intervening sequence'. They reasoned that if <italic>ycf15 </italic>is a functional protein in spinach, then the intervening sequence would need to be removed and the 5' and 3' sections spliced in order to make a functional <italic>ycf15 </italic>mature transcript. If the intervening sequence were not removed, numerous in-frame stop codons would lead to a truncated protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Reverse transcription experiments in spinach determined that <italic>ycf15 </italic>was not spliced (although it was transcribed) and so presumably was not translated in spinach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. They concluded that the <italic>ycf15 </italic>sequence, since it is highly conserved, probably has functional significance but probably does not code for a protein. Using an alternative approach, Goremykin et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] compared nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS) in <italic>ycf15 </italic>and found a ratio that suggests <italic>ycf15 </italic>is not a protein evolving under evolutionary constraint.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Alignment of the <italic>ycf15 </italic>region in six representative angiosperms. <italic>Atropa </italic>and <italic>Nicotiana </italic>represent the uninterrupted form.

Although the sequence is highly conserved, it is not an open reading frame in most taxa.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-8-174-4"/></fig><p>We examined the <italic>ycf2:trnL </italic>spacer region, where <italic>ycf15 </italic>is located, in several chloroplast genomes, including <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunculus</italic>, to determine the distribution and nature of <italic>ycf15 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Schmitz-Linneweber <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], based on their small sample of taxa, suggested that the distribution of the interrupted versus uninterrupted <italic>ycf15 </italic>sequence, whether or not the sequence codes for a protein, might have phylogenetic significance. That indeed appears to be the case; all taxa, among those we examined, that contain an uninterrupted <italic>ycf15 </italic>motif are asterids and no asterid has the interrupted form (although some lack the 5' portion of the motif). We assume, based on the sequence similarity of the intervening sequence, that the Schmitz-Linneweber <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] finding of lack of splicing in <italic>Spinacia </italic>is likely to hold for other interrupted forms of the motif. The existence of the widely distributed interrupted form suggests that this is not a protein-coding gene in any of these genomes. If this truly is a protein-coding gene in the asterids, we would have to imagine that pseudogenes (as the interrupted forms would be, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) are being retained, conserved over broad evolutionary distances, and either that the active form was inactivated multiple times by the insertion of the same intervening sequence at the same location or that an inactivated gene was re-activated in the asterids through the excision of the intervening sequence.

This conserved motif has been reported in the <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU intron of rice (ORF133), corn (ORF133), <italic>Pinus </italic>(ORF75a), <italic>Eucalyptus </italic>(ORF113) and <italic>Nymphaea</italic>. Wheat and sugarcane also contain an ORF in this region apparently homologous to that of rice and corn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We did not find an equivalent sequence in the chloroplast genome of any alga, which all lack an intron in the <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU gene, or in <italic>Selaginella</italic>, which lacks the <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In the plastid genomes of all other vascular plant taxa examined, a similar sequence occurs in the <italic>trnI </italic>intron but in the majority of cases it contains numerous frameshifts and stop codons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Based only on its length and lack of internal stop codons, the <italic>ycf68 </italic>sequence could represent a functional protein-coding gene in the grasses, Nymphaeales, and in the gymnosperms <italic>Pinus thunbergii </italic>and <italic>P. koraiensis</italic>. However, in the others it can only be, at most, a pseudogene. Again, it seems unlikely that a non-functional gene could remain as conserved as the motif seen here over such vast evolutionary distances. If the sequence has any functional significance it must be other than coding for a protein, for example, in intron excision or in gene regulation. We did attempt to detect relationships between the conserved <italic>ycf68 </italic>motif and folding of the intron without success (see methods).

We compared the <italic>ycf15</italic>-containing intergenic spacer as well as five other similarly sized IGS (two from the IR regions and three from the LSC) to the homologous regions in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, for each of 14 genomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> top). For <italic>ycf68</italic>, we did similar comparisons, using <italic>Zea </italic>as the reference taxon, of the <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU (<italic>ycf68</italic>-containing) intron, two other introns from the IR and three introns from the LSC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> bottom). In both cases, but especially for the intron (<italic>ycf68</italic>) comparison, it can be seen that other IGS or intron sequences are as (or even more) conserved as the <italic>ycf </italic>regions and that non-coding sequences (introns or IGS) are much more conserved in the IR than in the LSC. Thus, it is seems likely that these regions (<italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68</italic>) are conserved, not because they serve some function, but simply because they are in the inverted repeat; they simply appear to code for a polypeptide chain of suggestive length due to chance and are conserved across large evolutionary distances because of the especially low rates of change within the IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Sequence similarity comparisons of IGS and introns within the IR and the LSC.

As in these and other genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] where the genetic code is redundant, codons with a third position nucleotide of A or T(U) are used more frequently than those terminating in G or C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). The base composition at each of the three codon positions varies, with the first position having the lowest proportion of A+T and the third position the highest (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). It has been suggested that codon usage patterns are driven by this composition bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, when we apply methods to assess the impact of nucleotide composition on codon usage within <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunculus</italic>, it appears that the A+T-richness of the third position is at most a partial influence on codon usage. We used CodonW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] to calculate a variety of codon usage statistics that we then contrasted graphically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). COrrespondence Analysis of codon usage (COA) was calculated based on codon usage as well as Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU). In each case the first two axes together explained only a modest amount of the variation (15&#x02013;20%) and plotting each of the 56 degenerate codons on the first and second axes did not produce a pattern related to the A+T-richness of the third position in the codon sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> top), except that codons ending in A or T are more tightly clustered than the codons ending in G or C. These results suggest that A+T-richness is not the most important factor in explaining variation in codon use. In addition we graphed each gene on the two axes ENc (the effective number of codons) and GC3 (the G+C percentage at the third position) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> middle). If codon usage is random with respect to factors other than A+T-richness (i.e., GC content) of the third position, each gene is expected to fall on the prediction line for ENc based solely on its GC3 value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Again our results reinforce the finding that factors other than nucleotide composition are operating in the plastid genome to select among synonymous codons across genes, in that most points do not fall on the prediction line. Other studies, for example Wall and Herbeck's study of codon bias in the plastid gene <italic>rbcL </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], also have found that codon usage patterns are not explained by G+C patterns. Finally, we calculated COA eigen values for each gene for the <italic>Nuphar </italic>or <italic>Ranunculus </italic>genome (based on codon usage, RSCU or amino acid usage, the results are comparable although more obvious for codon or amino acid usage). The eigen values for the primary axes are higher (explain a higher proportion of the variation) than those seen for codons (about 25% in the case of the codon usage analyses) and plotting each gene on the first two axes produces patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> bottom) suggesting that different functional groups of genes have different codon usage and amino acid usage patterns as has been found in broader comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Overall, although A+T-richness of the third position is the most obvious pattern observable in plastome codon usage, other factors are important in determining codon usage patterns in particular genes (and perhaps genomes).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Codon usage (codon frequency relative to each amino acid) for <italic>Nuphar </italic>(Nuad) and

Interestingly, the distribution patterns of the numbers of IGS and the numbers of introns in the different percent identity categories appeared quite similar, suggesting that similar forces may impact both types of non-coding sequences.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Number of <italic>Nuphar </italic>plastome regions attaining different sequence identities relative to homologous <italic>Nymphaea </italic>plastome regions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Region</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>99&#x02013;100%</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>95&#x02013;98%</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>90&#x02013;94%</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>80&#x02013;89%</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>70&#x02013;79%</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>0&#x02013;69%</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Total</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>Protein</bold></td><td align="center">17</td><td align="center">63</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">83</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Intergenic</bold></td><td align="center">16</td><td align="center">29</td><td align="center">27</td><td align="center">23</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">110</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Introns</bold></td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>rRNA</bold></td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>tRNA</bold></td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Total</bold></td><td align="center">60</td><td align="center">111</td><td align="center">35</td><td align="center">25</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">247</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Detailed percent identity comparisons are rarely reported for individual regions of entire chloroplast genomes. One study compared sugar cane with rice, maize and wheat and reported comparisons as one of three categories: 0&#x02013;30%, 31&#x02013;79% and 80&#x02013;100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. As one might expect, most of the regions fell into the latter category. Timme <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] compared sequence divergence in both coding and non-coding regions between two completely sequenced chloroplast genomes from representatives of two of the subfamilies of Asteraceae. Their results showed that intergenic spacer regions were nearly two times as divergent as introns, and that the 10 most divergent coding sequences represent several different functional groups, including photosynthetic genes, ribosomal proteins, and <italic>ndh </italic>genes. Another study compared divergence within functional groups across four different species in three genera of Solanaceae and found that RNA and photosynthesis genes are the most conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], consistent with the results from a second Solanceae comparison based on individual coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Kim and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], in their comparison of coding regions (omitting the tRNA genes) from 16 fully sequenced vascular plant chloroplast genomes, found the four rRNA genes to be the least divergent, followed <italic>by psbA, psbD, rps12, psbE, psbL </italic>and <italic>petB</italic>. The most conserved coding regions in <italic>Nuphar-Nymphaea </italic>are similar in that the four rRNA genes, <italic>rps12, psbL </italic>and <italic>petB </italic>are also among the most conservative genes but differ in including <italic>petN, psbM</italic>, and <italic>rpl23 </italic>among the 10 most conserved coding regions.</p><p>We also examined indels (insertions and deletions) between <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea </italic>which, of course, are much more likely to occur in IGS than in coding regions. In our study, 88.6% of insertions and 89.9% of deletions occurred in IGS (data not shown), comparable to results from a similar comparison between sugarcane and maize where 84.9% of insertions and 74.2% of deletions occurred in IGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In another study, the comparison of two varieties of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) found 110 indels between those two plastid genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], whereas we found almost four times as many (413), but, of course, our taxa are less closely related. However a study comparing <italic>Atropa belladonna </italic>to <italic>Nicotiana tabaccum</italic>, a comparison perhaps more comparable to ours, found 65 insertions and 60 deletions equal to or larger than five bp in intergenic regions and introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], whereas we found 163 insertions and 206 deletions in <italic>Nuphar </italic>relative to <italic>Nymphaea</italic>. Together the combined lengths of the indels account for 0.08% of the total genome length of <italic>Atropa </italic>and 0.08% of the genome length in the rice comparison, but 0.23% of the genomic length in the <italic>Nuphar-Nymphaea </italic>comparison.</p><p>Only recently have plastome sequences been available for closely related taxa, allowing for detailed comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These comparisons suggest that non-coding sequences within the genome evolve more rapidly in terms of both substitution and indel mutations, although this is not universally so (some non-coding sequences are quite highly conserved). Comparisons across studies show that some regions are consistently slow to evolve and others commonly evolve at a higher rate but at least minor differences are seen across these studies. Before general patterns and processes can be identified more genomic data allowing for such comparisons will need to become available.</p></sec><sec><title>Repeat Analysis &#x02013; Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs)</title><p>We screened for perfect SSRs in <italic>Nuphar</italic>, <italic>Ranunculus </italic>and 24 other chloroplast genomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>). We report the number of mononucleotide repeats &#x02265; 8 nt, dinucleotide repeats &#x02265; 8 nt (i.e., four repeat units), and trinucleotide repeats &#x02265; 9 nt (i.e., three repeat units); hereafter referred to collectively as the 8,8,9 SSRs. We also report the number of longer repeats &#x02265; 10 nt/repeats for mononucleotide runs, &#x02265; 10 nt (or five copies of the repeat unit) for dinucleotide repeats, and &#x02265; 12 nt (i.e., four copies of the repeat unit) for trinucleotide repeats; referred to collectively as the 10,10,12 SSRs. Of course, any particular threshold (e.g., 8,8,9) is rather arbitrary and no consensus has developed on what nucleotide length or repeat unit number is significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. However, it has been suggested that SSRs of length 8 nt or more (regardless of repeat motif) are prone to slip-strand mispairing (SSM, thought to be the primary mutational mechanism to affect SSRs), whereas those of lesser length are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Elsewhere the critical threshold is estimated at 7&#x02013;10 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Other workers have chosen similar thresholds, of 8 or 10 nt, in their reports [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]]. The number of 8,8,9 SSRs vary from 152 in <italic>Pinus thunbergii </italic>to 393 in <italic>Lotus </italic>and comprise between 1 and 2.5% of the chloroplast genome. The number of 10,10,12 SSRs range from 16 in one of the rice genomes to 113 in <italic>Medicago</italic>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T7"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Number and maximum

If some genomes are generally more likely to contain SSRs (due to differences in mutational biases or selection pressures or other factors) and a common mechanism (or suite of mechanisms) controlled the likelihood of SSR presence, then a correlation between short and long SSRs would be predicted. Alternatively if some genomes were predisposed to long SSRs whereas others were less likely for SSRs to attain greater length, then no correlation might be seen or even a negative correlation might be observed. Genome size and total number of SSRs should be correlated if SSRs occur randomly. Both these comparisons showed a small but significant positive relationship. Genomes with a higher number of "short" SSRs (from the first to the second threshold) were more likely to have a higher number of "long" SSRs (at or above the second threshold) &#x02013; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> (top), r<sub>s </sub>= 0.534, p = 0.009. Larger genomes were more likely to contain more SSRs than smaller genomes &#x02013; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> (middle), r<sub>s </sub>= 0.542, p = 0.008 (r<sub>s </sub>= 0.524, p = 0.012 with <italic>Epifagus </italic>excluded). Thus we can infer that the larger the genome the more SSRs are to be expected and that "long" and "short" SSRs most likely are simply points on a continuum evolving under similar mechanisms. However these two factors explain only a portion of the variance in SSR number.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Scatter plots showing relationships between aspects of SSR frequency and other characteristics.

In these comparisons we characterized repeats based on nucleotide composition in addition to length and number. We then compared (data not shown) the predicted and observed number of repeats of various types and the predicted and observed ratios between repeats of various compositions. For all types of repeats, of all lengths and all compositions, in all genomes, fewer SSRs were observed than were predicted. In many cases the difference between the number of SSRs predicted and the number observed was more than an order of magnitude. For mononucleotide repeats in most angiosperms, the ratio of A or T (W) containing runs to G or C (S) containing runs was not significantly different from the ratio predicted from the genomic base composition. However, in the two Nymphaeaceae (<italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea</italic>), <italic>Pinus </italic>and <italic>Huperzia</italic>, the observed ratio of W to S mononucleotide SSRs was significantly different from the predicted ratio (Chi-Square test, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Interestingly the observed ratio was skewed in favor of S (G and C) containing repeats. When predicted ratios of dinucleotide repeats were calculated based on the overall nucleotide composition, all genomes showed a significantly biased ratio (Chi-square test, p &#x0003c; 0.001). In this case more WS SSRs were observed than expected and fewer WW SSRs. When the dinucleotide calculations were repeated based on the genomic dinucleotide frequencies, the deviation of the observed from the expected was less and for <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and <italic>Triticum </italic>was not significant. Again where there is a deviation from expected, the WS category is elevated and the WW category is reduced in the observed. Finally, in calculations related to trinucleotide SSR compositions and based on overall trinucleotide composition, all but <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and <italic>Triticum </italic>showed biased compositional ratios. Bias was due primarily to fewer WWW SSRs than expected. Thus, surprisingly, whenever the observed compositional ratio of SSRs was different from expectation (the majority of cases), the deviation was due to a deficiency of W (A and T) containing repeats.</p><p>Other (non-plastid) genomes that are A+T rich have been found to exhibit a strong overrepresentation of A or T mononucleotide SSRs, e.g., <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and various explanations for this have been offered. Because A-T base pairs are held together by two hydrogen bonds rather than three, A-T containing repeats are easier to denature and therefore perhaps more prone to slip-strand mispairing (SSM). Other explanations include mutational bias (i.e., G-C to A-T mutations being more likely than the reverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]), involvement of A-T runs in gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and regions being more mutagenic due to A-T runs (this increased mutability being selected for in regions where higher mutations rates would be advantageous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]). Although these proposals seem reasonable, SSRs (and specifically A and T containing SSRs) are underrepresented in the plastid genomes in contrast also to the work of Dieringer and Schlotterer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] who found SSRs overrepresented when comparing nine nuclear genomes. They predicted that the more biased from equal nucleotide composition the genome the greater the density of microsatellites (either mono- or di- nucleotide SSRs in their case). For the genomes considered in our detailed comparison, we tested for correlation between various aspects of nucleotide composition and SSR frequency. Only A and T mononucleotide repeat density correlated with genomic nucleotide composition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> bottom, r<sub>s </sub>= 0.81, p = 0.015). So this correlation can be seen even when the W repeats are not over represented. G and C mononucleotide repeat density did not correlate with nucleotide composition and di- and tri-nucleotide repeat densities correlated neither with genomic frequencies nor with di- or tri-nucleotide frequencies calculated over the entire genome (data not shown). We note that GpC and CpG based (SS) repeats are completely absent from all the plastid genomes examined. This may be the result of selection against these motifs in addition to simple nucleotide composition (these would be predicted to be very rare; about one SS repeat of length 8 nt per genome on average) as SS-based dinucleotide repeats are absent or strongly underrepresented in other genomes as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Presumably some mechanism (mutational or selectional) in the chloroplast genome is acting on the plastid genomes such that many fewer SSRs are observed than would be expected and that mechanism is acting more strongly on W-containing repeats than S-containing ones.</p><p>In an alternative attempt to clarify underlying patterns and mechanisms of SSR evolution, we compared the 10,10,12 SSRs between <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea </italic>to determine how many of the SSRs were shared (determined by identity of flanking sequence and repeat position as well as repeat motif) between these two genomes from relatively closely related plants (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The <italic>Nuphar </italic>genome contains more than twice as many 10,10,12 SSRs as the <italic>Nymphaea </italic>genome &#x02013; 52 in <italic>Nuphar</italic>, 23 in <italic>Nymphaea</italic>. Sixty-six different 10,10,12 SSRs occur in the combined set. The vast majority, but not all, of the SSRs occur in non-coding DNA (55 in IGS, six in introns, and five in coding regions). The majority (50 of 66) of these repeats are shared between the two genomes; most are simply lower than the reporting threshold in one genome or the other. Of the 50 shared SSRs, only seven are the same length in both genomes. Where the shared SSRs are of different lengths, in 18 cases length differences were due to SSM, in 14 cases due to a nucleotide substitution, in four cases due to an indel (a length mutation other than a change in repeat unit number) and in eight cases due to a combination of mechanisms. Of the 16 SSRs not shared, 14 were found only in <italic>Nuphar </italic>and only two in <italic>Nymphaea</italic>. Thus, it appears that <italic>Nuphar </italic>is more likely to have these SSRs and for the SSRs to be longer when they occur; in 30 of the 43 cases where shared repeats differ in length the <italic>Nuphar </italic>SSR is longer.</p><p>It is thought that SSRs begin as random runs of nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Any bias in mutation patterns or nucleotide composition would make certain runs more likely. Then, once present in a location, the repeat would grow via SSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Longer SSRs lead to more stable heteroduplex intermediates, making SSM more likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. However longer SSRs also have higher mutations rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. One model of SSR evolution posits that the distribution of repeat lengths in a genome represents an equilibrium between SSM and point mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In the <italic>Nuphar-Nymphaea </italic>comparison SSM and point mutation occur with about equal frequency, consistent with this hypothesis. In terms of phylogenetic utility of SSR variation, the <italic>Nuphar-Nymphaea </italic>comparison suggests that individual SSRs are stable at least over relatively short periods of evolutionary time and that they do commonly vary in repeat number. However the small size of most repeats probably limits their utility and more needs to be known about the specifics of SSR evolution before any phylogenetic utility can be fully realized. Understanding more about the processes of SSR evolution will also help us investigate possible selective or functional roles for these motifs.</p></sec><sec><title>Repeat Analysis &#x02013; Small Dispersed Repeats (SDR)</title><p>We also searched for SDRs in the plastomes of representative angiosperms. These repeats are based on a more complex motif and are longer than SSRs. Our SDR analysis, within each of the eight genomes, identified 114&#x02013;350 direct and inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least 80% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The number of repeats was lowest in <italic>Nymphaea </italic>(114) and highest in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>(350). In most cases, the number of direct repeats (62&#x02013;208) was substantially higher than the number of inverted repeats (32&#x02013;142). The vast majority (84&#x02013;97%) of the repeats were only 30&#x02013;40 bp in length and the longest repeat was 193 bp in <italic>Triticum</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>The number of SDRs of different length classes found in eight different angiosperm plastid genomes.

Although these comparisons were performed using the repeats in each of the eight genomes as the reference, we only present the results (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref>) using <italic>Nymphaea </italic>as the reference genome because it had the fewest number of repeats and thus would contain any repeats shared throughout all these genomes. Overall, the analyses identified 83 groups of shared repeats among these eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes, ranging in length from 30 to 49 bp. The majority of the shared repeats were located within intergenic spacer regions and introns. However repeats were sometimes found within genes and some cases represented inter-tRNA similarities within different families of tRNA genes. The largest shared repeat (49 bp) represents shared sequence between <italic>psaA </italic>and <italic>psaB</italic>. In general, the longer shared SDRs (36 &#x02013; 49 bp) tend to have lower A+T-richness (at the level of the genome or lower). However, most (68 of the 83) of the shared SDRs are short, between 30 and 32 nt in length. This class of SDRs shows the widest range in A+T-richness (29% to 97%) but most exhibit A+T-richness of greater than 50%. Most shared SDRs are present in only a small number of copies. Only two repeats occur more than four times in the genomes (both are found in introns and IGS and exhibit A+T richness less than that of the genomes overall); one is 42 nt long (51% AT) and the other, occurring about 10 times, is 40 nt long (54% AT). Overall, no trends were detected between repeat location, number, length, and A+T-richness.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Shared repeats among eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Repeat Size (AT%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>Nymphaea </italic>(reference genome)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>

Dispersed repeats are found more commonly in genomes that have experienced changes in genome organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], especially in highly rearranged algal genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. A correlation between the number of repeats and the extent of gene order change has been suggested for algal genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. However, comparisons of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes of the angiosperm families Fabaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], Solanaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and Asteraceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] have revealed the presence of numerous small repeats scattered throughout these genomes even though these genomes have few if any rearrangements. In each of these families assessed by others, most of the repeats are 20 &#x02013; 40 bp in length and they are located mostly in intergenic spacer regions and introns, although several are located in the protein-coding genes <italic>psaA</italic>, <italic>psaB</italic>, and <italic>ycf2</italic>. Our examination of repeats here in eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes, representing a wider phylogenetic diversity than that of earlier studies, identified numerous repeats in each genome of a nature and pattern similar to those reported by others based on narrower comparisons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Again here, some of the shared SDR repeats, such as those located in tRNA genes and those shared between <italic>psaA </italic>and <italic>psaB</italic>, result from conserved sequence similarity of related genes. The vast majority of the plastome SDRs are restricted to intergenic spacer regions and introns and are small in size. Earlier work suggesting that larger repeats (of a size detectable via Southern Hybridization) are rare in unrearranged plastid genomes is supported. However, the pattern that seems to be emerging from all of these analyses is that small SDRs in angiosperm genomes are quite common and they tend to be located in the same regions. The role of these conserved repeats is not known but given that many of them are shared broadly and are located in the same regions suggests that some may be functional.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>As additional chloroplast genomes from less-derived angiosperm taxa are characterized we obtain a clearer picture of the ancestral plastid genome organization for angiosperms. In large part these additional genomes (reported here and by others) confirm that the <italic>Nicotiana </italic>plastome is reasonably inferred to represent the ancestral angiosperm for gene content and organization, although perhaps not for exact IR boundaries. With notable exceptions, these features, seen in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, are remarkably conserved in most angiosperm lineages. The <italic>Nuphar advena </italic>and <italic>Ranuculus macranthus </italic>chloroplast genome sequences add to this growing body of data for reconstructing the evolution of plastid genomes. The <italic>Nuphar </italic>genome, in addition, provided the opportunity for comparison with the relatively closely related <italic>Nymphaea alba </italic>plastome sequence. This comparison confirmed views on the conservative nature of the genome, with even some IGS regions showing very high levels of nucleotide similarity. The <italic>Nuphar-Nymphaea </italic>comparison also supported the view that SSR frequencies represent a balance between two mutation types: SSM and substitutions. Detailed comparisons among these and other genomes reveal many differences and unexplained conservation of features that both remain to be understood. However, we are able to suggest that the widely conserved sequences designated <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>are not protein-coding genes.</p><p>As has been noted many times elsewhere, chloroplast genomes are biased towards A and T nucleotides, i.e., are "A+T-rich", except for the RNA genes. Howe <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] suggest that the A+T-richness of plastid genomes is the result of endosymbiosis (or at least enhanced due to endosymbiosis). They argue that there might be a selective advantage for a particular protein-coding gene to be either A+T-rich or G+C-rich and that each class of genes can be maintained through compartmentalization in the different genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. However, many other genomes, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, are as A+T-rich as (or even more biased than) plastid genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. We suggest that the plastome A+T bias is relatively modest and results from a slight mutation and/or error checking bias of the plastid DNA polymerases or perhaps some selection for A and T in otherwise neutral positions to increase ease of denaturation during replication or transcription. In any event, a bias can be seen in overall composition, in the composition of the 3<sup>rd </sup>position of codons, and in which SSR motifs are most abundant, among other aspects of the genomic sequence. However on closer inspection A+T richness does not correlate with variation in codon usage or details of SSR abundance. We speculate that the interesting patterns are those that fail to track patterns of A+T-richness; for example, repeat sequences in non-coding regions enriched for G and C are the ones more likely to be functional and understanding the components of codon bias that is <underline>not</underline> related to A+T-richness is more likely to be significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DNA Sources</title><p>Leaf material of <italic>Nuphar advena </italic>(Aiton) W.

We will provide an overview of our approach here.</p><p>Draft genomic sequence was prepared from the cpDNA preparations at the DOE Joint Genome Institute. To do so, the DNA was sheared by passage through a narrow aperture and then fragments averaging 3 kb were selected from an agarose gel and cloned into plasmids, which were then used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic>. Clones were randomly selected from these libraries and placed into 384-well plates and templates amplified for sequencing using rolling circle amplification. When sequenced, forward and reverse plasmid sequencing primers produced 500&#x02013;750 bp of sequence data (reads) from each end of the inserts. The individual reads were then processed and assembled into contigs using Phred and Phrap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Four or five plates (generating 768 reads each) provide 8&#x02013;10&#x000d7; coverage if the library is 60&#x02013;80% cpDNA.</p><p>In the case of <italic>Nuphar</italic>, one library was constructed. The sequencing reads from five plates assembled into a draft genome composed of a single contig. In the case of <italic>Ranunculus</italic>, three libraries were constructed and fourteen plates of sequence data were generated. These data assembled into a draft genome composed of a single contig. The draft sequences were then assessed visually using Consed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] to determine the level of quality of each nucleotide. Each nucleotide in each read was assigned a quality score using Phred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Our minimum criterion was two reads with a quality score of &#x02265; 20 for each position. At the vast majority of positions this criterion was greatly exceeded, but occasionally areas of low coverage occurred and there were some instances where the minimum criterion was not met. In those cases, we designed primers to flank the regions of these "quality gaps", PCR amplified a product that contained the questionable nucleotide or nucleotides, and sequenced the PCR product until the criterion was met. Five regions of low quality were confirmed in this manner in <italic>Nuphar </italic>and two in <italic>Ranunculus</italic>.</p><p>We also confirmed the extent of the IR with a PCR and sequencing strategy. In the shotgun sequencing approach, the two copies of the IR are not sequenced separately. Like the remainder of the genome, the sequence for the IR region is built up via the overlap and assembly of the 500&#x02013;700 bp sequencing reads. Sequences derived from templates representing both copies of the IR assemble together. The IR can be recognized generally in Consed as the depth of sequencing reads doubles in that region and the boundaries can be inferred where the two reads from a single clone assemble far from each other. However to precisely define the boundaries we designed primers to amplify across each of the four IR-single copy junctions, sequenced the PCR products and compared those sequences to one another and to the draft genome. In this manner we were able to confirm the precise location of the IR-LSC and IR-SSC boundaries.</p></sec><sec><title>Annotation and related studies</title><p>We used DOGMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] as our primary tool for annotating these two genomes. DOGMA uses BLASTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] to compare the genomic sequence against a custom database of genes constructed using corrected annotations of 17 completely sequenced chloroplast genomes. This produces a draft annotation that is then inspected using DOGMA's tools for accurate assessment of the start and codon of each gene and any contained exon-intron boundaries. Because of the limitations of BLAST searches, small exons (6&#x02013;9 nucleotides) that occur in three chloroplast genes cannot be found by DOGMA or by using other versions of Blast searches, so these were located manually. Putative gene and exon boundaries are determined by detailed comparison with other annotated genomes and individual gene sequences; no expression or protein studies were conducted to confirm the assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigations of ycf15 and ycf68</title><p>To investigate the distribution and nature of <italic>ycf15</italic>, we extracted the <italic>ycf15 </italic>sequence from the <italic>Nicotiana tabaccum </italic>genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_001879">NC_001879</ext-link>) and conducted pairwise BLAST searches between this and each of the 63 then-available complete chloroplast genome sequences. If any portion of the <italic>ycf15 </italic>sequence was not detected in comparisons against whole genome sequences, the <italic>ycf2:trnL </italic>spacer region was extracted and just that portion of the genome was compared to the <italic>Nicotiana ycf15 </italic>sequence. ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] alignments were also conducted to assess levels of conservation in a subset of genomes.</p><p>Pairwise BLAST (bl2seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]) was also used to assess <italic>ycf68 </italic>distributional patterns, here using the <italic>ycf68 </italic>sequence from <italic>Zea </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea </italic>against all 63 then-published plastid genomes. Also, since <italic>ycf68 </italic>is found in the <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU intron, it seemed possible that the conserved sequence could be related to folding during excision. The <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU intron was extracted using NCBI or DOGMA from all the species listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> that contain an intron in <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU and folded using the web-based programs mfold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] and DINAmelt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] using default settings. We then examined the folding patterns to look for regions with conserved folding domains. We saw no obvious correlation between the position of the region of sequence similarity and the folding structure hypothesized by either program.</p><p>Another method for investigating the functionality of an ORF was designed by Echols <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. They looked at codon usage in pseudogenes, genes, and intergenic regions to determine how pseudogenes were evolving and if amino acid frequency could be an indicator of the functionality of a conserved region of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. They separately calculated the frequency of amino acids in coding, noncoding, and known pseudogene sequences and then graphed the results to display trends of usage in the three sequence types. They found that the amino acid frequency in pseudogenes was an exact intermediate between amino acid frequency in known genes and intergenic DNA, and argued that this method is a valid way to determine whether or not a gene is functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We used this method to investigate whether or not <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>had amino acid frequencies similar to coding, noncoding, or an intermediate to differentiate among the hypotheses that the ycfs are genes, pseudogenes, or simply non-coding DNA. Algorithms from web-based suite of tools BABEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] were used to calculate the frequency of amino acids. For <italic>Ranunculus </italic>and <italic>Nuphar</italic>, we input all coding DNA sequences and recorded the amino acid frequency. We determined codon usage in the noncoding sequence by averaging the codon usage for each reading frame (the difference in frequency among the six reading frames is minimal) to get a frequency estimate. BABEL tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] were also used to calculate amino acid frequency in the intron sequence of <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU and the <italic>ycf2:trnL</italic>-CAA intergenic region. These results were then graphed. In the Echols <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] analysis the amino acid frequency for each amino acid was graphed in order of decreasing levels of variation. We tried multiple methods for arranging the amino acids including that of Echols <italic>et al</italic>., alphabetical, high and low frequency, standard deviation of the frequency across all types of DNA, etc. We found that manipulation of the order of amino acids on the X-axis changed the results so much that we could display evidence for any of the hypotheses under consideration. Therefore, we do not believe that this type of analysis is valid, at least not with our data. Perhaps with the larger sample sizes, from nuclear genomes, available to Echols <italic>et al</italic>. the approach is more consistent.</p><p>We further investigated the characteristics of <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>by comparing sequence similarity of the <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU intron and the intergenic spacer between <italic>ycf2 </italic>and <italic>trnL</italic>-CAA to other introns and intergenic spacers throughout the chloroplast genome to see if the intergenic/intron regions containing <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68 </italic>are more conserved than that of other noncoding DNA in the chloroplast genome. We used the web-based program Mulan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to compare noncoding DNA in our sequences to a reference sequence &#x02013; <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>for <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>Zea mays </italic>for <italic>ycf68</italic>. Mulan performs pairwise sequence comparisons of the input sequence to the chosen reference sequence. We used the default setting of 100 for the ECR (evolutionary conserved region) length, the minimum amount of base pairs that have to align for similarity to register on the histogram, and 50 percent for the ECR similarity. The algorithm then returns graphical information about the likeness of the input sequences to the reference sequence; output is in the form of a histogram showing the similarity of the sequences from 50 to 100 percent. To see if introns were commonly conserved at a level equivalent to that represented by the <italic>ycf68 </italic>motif, we compared the intron in <italic>trnI</italic>-GAU with a sample of other introns within the inverted repeat (<italic>trnA</italic>-UGC and <italic>ndhB</italic>), and in the large single copy region (<italic>trnG</italic>-UCC, <italic>trnL</italic>-UAA, and <italic>trnV-</italic>UAC). To investigate conservation of the nucleotide sequence in the <italic>ycf2</italic>:<italic>trnL </italic>intergenic spacer, relative to the <italic>ycf15 </italic>question, we compared it to intergenic DNA that is outside of known operons in the inverted repeat (3'<italic>rps12</italic>:<italic>trnV</italic>-GAC and <italic>trnN-</italic>GUU:<italic>ycf1</italic>) and the large single copy region (<italic>rpoB</italic>:<italic>trnC</italic>-GCA, <italic>trnT</italic>-GGU:<italic>psbD</italic>, and <italic>psaA</italic>:<italic>ycf3</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Codon Usage</title><p>Alternative start codon usage was determined based on published annotations with additional comparisons. All genes annotated with an alternative start were aligned to determine whether or not the start was homologous with non-alternative start codons in other taxa. If the annotated alternative start was the result of a longer or shorter annotation, the region homologous to the start codon of other taxa was examined to determine whether or not the normal start codon was present.</p><p>Codon usage patterns for each genome were determined using FREQSQ from BABEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] and CodonW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The predicted relationship of ENc and GC3 was determined using Wright's equation as given by Novembre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The equation as printed in the Wright 1990 paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] contains a typographical error.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuphar-Nymphaea comparison</title><p>The complete chloroplast genome of <italic>Nuphar </italic>was sub-divided into individual coding and non-coding regions, and each region was compared against the entire <italic>Nymphaea </italic>genome using the BLAST2 algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. The output files from BLAST2 were used to determine the percent similarity of each region. BLAST2 presents errors when one sequence under comparison contains mononucleotide repeats with runs greater than six nucleotides; n is indicated in place of each repeating nucleotide at those positions and considered "non-matching" in similarity calculations. These errors were checked against the genome sequences and corrected before calculations were made. Nucleotide sequence fragments that BLAST2 did not align (and did not show) were scored as zeros and negatively affected the % identity value. For example if only 425 of the known 450 nucleotides in a gene were aligned by BLAST2, and it was otherwise a perfect match, then the % identity would be 425/450 or 94.4%. BLAST2 does not display insertions or deletion events (indels) of greater than 10 nucleotides; such a disparity between the sequences would lead to the two adjoining regions of similarity being displayed as separate regions of identity.</p><p>We looked at indels as well as nucleotide similarity. We characterized indels as insertions or deletions relative to <italic>Nuphar</italic>. If <italic>Nuphar </italic>contained sequence for which there was no equivalent in <italic>Nymphaea </italic>is was considered an insertion, whereas if nucleotides in the <italic>Nymphaea </italic>sequence lacked a <italic>Nuphar </italic>equivalent it was a deletion. We used BLAST2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] to quantify indels in coding regions only. MULAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] was used to produce a total genome alignment for <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea</italic>. Indels in the entire genome were quantified using this output. Simple subtraction of the coding region indels from the total number of indels provided the number found in intergenic regions. We quantified indels of 5&#x02013;9 bp, 10&#x02013;19 bp and 20 or greater bp.</p></sec><sec><title>SSR Analysis</title><p>To locate and characterize SSRs in these genomes, we used the Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) Extractor Utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. We screened for all perfect mono-, di- and tri-nucleotide repeats of length at least 8,8, or 9 nucleotides, respectively. We also determined the number and nature of mono-, di- and tri- nucleotide repeats of length at least 10, 10 or 12 nucleotides. In addition to analyzing SSR content of <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunculus</italic>, we examined the chloroplast genomes of the other completely sequenced land plant genomes available at the time of the analysis. These chloroplast genome sequences were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>). To assess possible relationships between the number of longer SSRs and the number of shorter SSRs as well as the number of SSRs and genome size and A+T-richness and frequencies of particular SSR motifs, we conducted Spearman rank correlation tests using an online calculator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Predicted numbers of SSRs of particular composition were calculated based on the underlying compositional nucleotide frequencies. For example, if A+T frequency in the genome overall is 0.638 then the frequency of a mononucleotide repeat of length 8 nt would be (0.638)<sup>8 </sup>and the number of length 8nt A+T SSRs expected would be the frequency* (genome length/SSR length). To determine whether the composition of SSRs deviated from expectation based on overall nucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies of the genomes (determined using FREQSQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]), we used a Chi-square test. Predicted number of each class of repeat was calculated as the ((expected frequency of a particular type of repeat, calculated as just stated)/(total of expected frequencies of all categories)) * observed total number of repeats. For example, in <italic>Huperzia</italic>, which has an A+T frequency of 0.638 and a G+C frequency of 0.362, the expected frequency of A+T mononucleotide repeats of length 8 is (0.638)<sup>8 </sup>and of G+C 8 nt mononucleotide SSRs is (0.362)<sup>8</sup>. The expected number of A+T mononucleotide runs, given that 147 mononucleotide repeats of 8nt and longer are observed in that genome, is (0.638)<sup>8</sup>/((0.638)<sup>8</sup>*(0.362)<sup>8</sup>)*147 = 145.44. We did simplify the calculations by basing our predictions on repeats of minimum length, which was also the mean and median length (i.e., we considered all the repeats that we observed to be of minimum length for these calculations).</p></sec><sec><title>SDR analysis</title><p>Shared and unique direct and inverted repeats were identified for eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes using the Comparative Repeat Analysis program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. This program uses REPuter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] but it has two additional features: it filters out repeats that are contained entirely within other repeats, and it identifies shared repeats among the input genomes by Blasting the repeats from each genome against all other genomes. For repeat identification, the following settings were used: (i) minimum repeat size of 30 bp; (ii) 90% or greater sequence identity, based on Hamming distance equal to 3; and (iii) an e-value of 2 for Blast comparisons against the other genomes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>bp &#x02013; base pair</p><p>COA &#x02013; Correspondence Analysis of Codon Usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]</p><p>CpG (or GpC or ApT, etc) &#x02013; to nucleotides adjacent on one DNA strand and thus linked by a phosphodiester bond (symbolized by the p)</p><p>DOGMA &#x02013; Dual Organellar Genome Annotator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]</p><p>ENc &#x02013; Effective number of codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]</p><p>GC3 &#x02013; percent G+C at the 3<sup>rd </sup>position of codons</p><p>IGS &#x02013; intergenic spacer</p><p>IR &#x02013; inverted repeat</p><p>LSC &#x02013; large single copy region</p><p>nt &#x02013; nucleotide</p><p>RSCU &#x02013; relative synonymous codon usage</p><p>S &#x02013; "strong" nucleotide (G or C)</p><p>SDR &#x02013; small dispersed repeat</p><p>SSC &#x02013; small single copy region</p><p>SSM &#x02013; slip strand mispairing</p><p>SSR &#x02013; simple sequence repeat</p><p>W &#x02013; "weak" nucleotide (A or T)</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LAR conceived of the project, drafted the manuscript, conducted the SSR, nucleotide composition and codon usage analyses and helped with and coordinated other aspects of the project; RP finished the <italic>Ranunculus </italic>sequence, completed the annotations of the two genomes, prepared the GenBank submissions, made the comparisons related to <italic>ycf15 </italic>and <italic>ycf68</italic>, compared SSRs of <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea</italic>, compared <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunuclus </italic>with other genomes for gene content, gene order and start codon usage, and drafted manuscript sections related to her work; TWC performed the finishing and initial annotation work on <italic>Nuphar</italic>, conducted experiments to confirm IR boundaries, and helped generate genome map figures; CD performed comparisons between <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Nymphaea</italic>, the initial COA analyses of codon usage in <italic>Nuphar </italic>and <italic>Ranunculus</italic>, and drafted the manuscript section related to the <italic>Nuphar-Nymphaea </italic>comparisons; HMF and JLB generated the draft sequence for the two genomes; RKJ assisted in the preparation of the sequencing templates, helped with the annotation of <italic>Nuphar</italic>, performed the SDR analyses, drafted the SDR manuscript section, and contributed to the design of the project.
