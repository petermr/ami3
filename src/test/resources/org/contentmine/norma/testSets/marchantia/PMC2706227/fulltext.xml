Before this study, only one polypod and two basal ferns had their complete chloroplast (cp) genome reported. Tree ferns represent an ancient fern lineage that first occurred in the Late Triassic. In recent phylogenetic analyses, tree ferns were shown to be the sister group of polypods, the most diverse group of living ferns. Availability of cp genome sequence from a tree fern will facilitate interpretation of the evolutionary changes of fern cp genomes. Here we have sequenced the complete cp genome of a scaly tree fern <italic>Alsophila spinulosa </italic>(Cyatheaceae).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome is 156,661 base pairs (bp) in size, and has a typical quadripartite structure with the large (LSC, 86,308 bp) and small single copy (SSC, 21,623 bp) regions separated by two copies of an inverted repeat (IRs, 24,365 bp each). This genome contains 117 different genes encoding 85 proteins, 4 rRNAs and 28 tRNAs. Pseudogenes of <italic>ycf66 </italic>and <italic>trnT-UGU </italic>are also detected in this genome. A unique <italic>trnR-UCG </italic>gene (derived from <italic>trnR-CCG</italic>) is found between <italic>rbcL </italic>and <italic>accD</italic>. The <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome shares some unusual characteristics with the previously sequenced cp genome of the polypod fern <italic>Adiantum capillus-veneris</italic>, including the absence of 5 tRNA genes that exist in most other cp genomes. The genome shows a high degree of synteny with that of <italic>Adiantum</italic>, but differs considerably from two basal ferns (<italic>Angiopteris evecta </italic>and <italic>Psilotum nudum</italic>). At one endpoint of an ancient inversion we detected a highly repeated 565-bp-region that is absent from the <italic>Adiantum </italic>cp genome. An additional minor inversion of the <italic>trnD-GUC</italic>, which is possibly shared by all ferns, was identified by comparison between the fern and other land plant cp genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By comparing four fern cp genome sequences it was confirmed that two major rearrangements distinguish higher leptosporangiate ferns from basal fern lineages. The <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome is very similar to that of the polypod fern <italic>Adiantum </italic>in terms of gene content, gene order and GC content. However, there exist some striking differences between them: the <italic>trnR-UCG </italic>gene represents a putative molecular apomorphy of tree ferns; and the repeats observed at one inversion endpoint may be a vestige of some unknown rearrangement(s). This work provided fresh insights into the fern cp genome evolution as well as useful data for future phylogenetic studies.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The chloroplast (cp) genome has long been a focus of research in plant molecular evolution and systematics due to its small size, high copy number, conservation and extensive characterization at the molecular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. More recently, with technical advances in DNA sequencing, the number of completely sequenced cp genomes has grown rapidly. Aside from providing information on genome structure, gene content, gene order and nucleotide composition, complete cp genome sequences also offer a unique opportunity to explore the evolutionary changes of the genome itself. In general, cp genomes are structurally highly conserved across land plants. However, structural rearrangements, e.g. gene loss, inverted repeat (IR) loss or expansion and inversion, do occur in certain lineages and have been shown to be extremely informative in resolving deep phylogenetic relationships because they may exhibit less homoplasy than sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For example, a 30-kb inversion shared by all vascular plants except lycopsids identifies the lycopsids as the basal lineage in the vascular plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two inversions and an IR expansion can be used to clarify basal nodes in the leptosporangiate ferns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Currently, one limiting factor in comparative chloroplast genomics is the sparse taxon sampling in spore-bearing land plants. The representation of genome sequencing almost always favors plants of economic interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Complete cp genomes have been sequenced for more than one hundred seed plants. Amongst these, more than 10 completed sequences each are from cereals (13), crucifers (12) and conifers (12) respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). But for other land plants, excluding seed plants, only 10 cp genome sequences have been achieved in total, of which only 3 are from ferns prior this study (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). For further insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cp genome organization, more data from plant species representative of other crucial evolutionary nodes is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Ferns (monilophytes), with more than 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of seed-free vascular plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have uncovered considerable genomic rearrangements in fern cp genomes, but the details and exact series of these events have not yet been fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The completed cp genome sequence of the polypod fern <italic>Adiantum capillus-veneris </italic>shows some unusual features not seen in vascular plants before, including tRNA gene losses, which had only been observed in cp genomes of non-photosynthetic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, a putative <italic>tRNA-selenocysteine </italic>(<italic>tRNA-Sec</italic>) gene in <italic>Adiantum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] replaces the typical <italic>trnR-CCG </italic>gene. Unfortunately, because <italic>Adiantum </italic>is the only sequenced representative of leptosporangiates, the most diverse fern lineage, it is difficult to tell which characteristics are unique to <italic>Adiantum </italic>or diagnostic of a much larger clade. Therefore, complete cp genome data from more fern clades are necessary to better resolve these issues.</p><p>As part of an effort to shed more light on the cp genome evolution in ferns, we have sequenced the complete plastid genome of a scaly tree fern <italic>Alsophila spinulosa </italic>(ab. <italic>Alsophila</italic>) (Cyatheaceae). This taxon was chosen because it is an easily available representative of an ancient lineage &#x02013; tree ferns, for which no cp genome has been sequenced before. In addition to tree ferns, heterosporous and polypod ferns are the other two main lineages within the "core leptosporangiates" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The three major lineages of "core leptosporangiates" were thought to have originated from a Late Triassic diversification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recent phylogenetic studies further demonstrated a sister relationship between tree ferns and polypods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. After the Late Triassic diversification, polypods remarkably re-diversified along with angiosperms in the Cretaceous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Similarly, the scaly tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) also radiated very recently and diversified at an exceptionally high rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A comparison of the complete cp genome sequences between <italic>Alsophila </italic>and the polypod fern <italic>Adiantum </italic>will aid interpretation of unusual characters observed in <italic>Adiantum</italic>, such as some missing and novel genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, sequences of all four published fern cp genomes (including that of <italic>Alsophila</italic>) will enable more detailed comparisons of the organization and evolution of the chloroplast genomes in ferns. Our comparative analyses corroborate that fern cp genomes have undergone substantial changes in gene orders during evolution: two main rearrangements contribute to major differences between "higher" and basal ferns. In addition, the comparisons also identify some unique characteristics in the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome including a novel tRNA, interesting pseudogenes and a highly repeated 565-bp-region spanning one endpoint of an ancient inversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>General Features</title><p>The chloroplast (cp) genome of <italic>Alsophila spinulosa </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ556581">FJ556581</ext-link>] is 156,661 base pairs (bp) with a large single copy (LSC) region of 86,308 bp separated from a 21,623-bp small single copy (SSC) region by two inverted repeats (IRs), each of 24,365 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The genome is the largest amongst the four sequenced fern cp genomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), but is smaller than previous estimates of other Cyatheaceae species, e.g. <italic>Alsophila bryophila </italic>(165 kb), <italic>Cyathea furfuracea </italic>(179.2 kb) and <italic>Sphaeropteris cooperi </italic>(164.3 kb), using the mapping method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. When the IR is considered only once, the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome contains 117 genes, encoding 85 proteins, 4 rRNAs and 28 tRNAs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

More than half of the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome is composed of coding regions (92,691 bp, 59.17%) with the protein-coding regions accounting for the major portion (81,111 bp, 51.77%) followed by rRNA genes (9,086 bp, 5.80%) and tRNA genes (2,494 bp, 1.59%) (counting both IRs).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of general features of fern chloroplast genomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>Alsophila spinulosa</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>Adiantum capillus-veneris</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>Psilotum nudum</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>Angiopteris evecta</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Total Length (bp)</td><td align="right">156661</td><td align="right">150568</td><td align="right">138829</td><td align="right">153901</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;GC content (%)</td><td align="right">40.43</td><td align="right">42.01</td><td align="right">36.03</td><td align="right">35.48</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LSC Length (bp)</td><td align="right">86308</td><td align="right">82282</td><td align="right">84617</td><td align="right">89709</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;GC content (%)</td><td align="right">39.62</td><td align="right">40.82</td><td align="right">33.63</td><td align="right">33.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SSC Length (bp)</td><td align="right">21623</td><td align="right">21392</td><td align="right">16304</td><td align="right">22086</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;GC content (%)</td><td align="right">37.85</td><td align="right">37.10</td><td align="right">29.97</td><td align="right">33.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IR Length (bp)</td><td align="right">24365</td><td align="right">23447</td><td align="right">18954</td><td align="right">21053</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;GC content (%)</td><td align="right">43.02</td><td align="right">46.33</td><td align="right">44.00</td><td align="right">40.65</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of gene<sup>a</sup></td><td align="right">117</td><td align="right">117</td><td align="right">118</td><td align="right">121</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Protein gene</td><td align="right">85</td><td align="right">84</td><td align="right">81</td><td align="right">85</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;rRNA gene</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;tRNA gene</td><td align="right">28</td><td align="right">29<sup>b</sup></td><td align="right">33</td><td align="right">32</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>The genes in IRs were considered only once</p><p><sup>b </sup><italic>trnSeC </italic>was counted here according to the annotation in GenBank and the reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gene map of the <italic>Alsophila spinulosa </italic>chloroplast genome</bold>.

Like other land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], GC content is unevenly distributed across the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome by location, functional group and codon position. The GC content in rRNA genes (55.18%) and tRNA genes (54.55%) is much higher than in protein coding regions (40.87%). The GC percentage in IRs is the highest (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), reflecting the high GC content of rRNA genes. Amongst the protein genes, photosynthetic genes possess the highest GC content (43.85%), followed by genetic system genes (40.80%), whilst NADH genes have the least (39.54%). The GC content also varies by codon position with the first (47.75%) &#x0003e; second (40.94%) &#x0003e; third (33.91%) position in turn.</p><p>The start codons of 85 protein genes were inferred by comparisons with previously annotated land plant cp genomes. Sixty-three of these genes start with AUG, 20 with ACG and 2 with GUG (<italic>psbC </italic>and <italic>rps12</italic>). An ACG codon may be restored to a canonical start codon (AUG) by RNA editing, whereas a GUG initiation codon has been reported in other cp genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Inferring translation start positions based only on genome sequences is merely hypothetical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Future determination of sequences from complementary DNA (cDNA) and/or proteins will help to substantiate the putative translation start positions as well as RNA editing sites.</p><p>There are in total 27,046 codons in all protein coding regions (including coding regions in both IRs) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), representing the total coding capacity of the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome; of these, 2771 (10.25%) are for leucine, 2365 (8.74%) for serine, 2154 (7.96%) for isoleucine, and 1847 (6.83%) for glycine. One third of the total codons are represented by these four amino acids. The codon usage of the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome reflects an apparent AT bias. Most codons end in A or U (66.13%). As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, both codon numbers and RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) values are negatively correlated with codon GC content (represented by the number of G+C in a given codon).

Since the UUA is also a preferred leucine codon for the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome (RSCU = 1.70), the same editing event might occur in the <italic>Alsophila </italic>chloroplast as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Missing tRNA gene</title><p>Only 28 tRNA genes are encoded in the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome, whereas 29, 32 and 33 are annotated in <italic>Adiantum</italic>, <italic>Angiopteris </italic>and <italic>Psilotum</italic>, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

This number of repeats is less than are found in some highly rearranged cp genomes (e.g. <italic>Trachelium caeruleum</italic>) but more than are present in unrearranged ones (e.g. <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Up to 66 direct repeats (no inverted repeat) are restricted to a region spanning only 565 bp (153,682&#x02013;154,246 bp in IRA or 88,724&#x02013;89,288 bp in IRB) between <italic>trnR-ACG </italic>and <italic>&#x003c8;trnT-UGU </italic>in the IRs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The GC content of this 565-bp-region (35.93%) is lower than that of IRs and the overall GC content of the whole genome. Detailed sequence analyses revealed that this region is composed of tandem iterations of 11 similar segments ranging from 40 to 58 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The core repeated motif is AAAATCCTAGTAGTTAgaGCTTTATCcaGGGtaTaGgACT (the lowercase letters denote variable bases) with variant lengths of heads and/or tails (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Repetitive units within the highly repeated 565-bp sequence</bold>.

In the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome, the length of the intergenic region between <italic>trnR-ACG </italic>and <italic>&#x003c8;trnT-UGU </italic>is 1467 bp, whereas in <italic>Adiantum </italic>it is 913 bp, the difference being 554 bp. We noted that this length is very similar to that of the highly repeated 565-bp-region, and speculate that the difference is caused by the presence of the highly repeated region.

Dispersed repeated sequences have been reported from several cp genomes. These are associated with numerous DNA rearrangements, particularly inversions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In extensively rearranged cp genomes, the endpoints of rearranged gene clusters are usually flanked by repeated sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. If repeat-mediated recombination is the major mechanism generating inversions in cp genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the preservation of repeats would destabilize the genome structure. After inversions, the repeats should be deleted to guarantee genome stability (like the situation in <italic>Adiantum</italic>). The repeats observed at the endpoint of the ancient inversion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Inversion II) may be a vestige of recent rearrangement(s) that are undiscovered. The existence of these repeats implies that the region is a potential hotspot for genomic reconfiguration.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we present the first complete cp genome sequence from a tree fern and provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of cp genomes in ferns. The cp genome size of <italic>Alsophila </italic>is larger than that of <italic>Adiantum, Psilotum </italic>and <italic>Angiopteris</italic>. Besides 117 genes, two pseudogenes <italic>&#x003a8;ycf66 </italic>and <italic>&#x003a8;trnT-UGU </italic>are also detected in the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome. An intact <italic>ycf66 </italic>is identified in <italic>Angiopteris</italic>, while an intron-containing <italic>trnT-UGU </italic>is found in <italic>Adiantum</italic>. Based on the findings, we speculate that <italic>&#x003a8;ycf66 </italic>reflects an intermediate during <italic>ycf66 </italic>gene loss, and the genesis of <italic>trnT-UGU </italic>may be associated with the IR rearrangements. A <italic>trnR-UCG </italic>gene was detected between <italic>rbcL </italic>and <italic>accD </italic>in <italic>Alsophila</italic>, and this seems to be a molecular apomorphy of tree ferns. In the <italic>Adiantum </italic>cp genome, the <italic>trnR-UCG </italic>gene degenerates to a pseudogene. The <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome shares several unusual characteristics with the previously sequenced <italic>Adiantum </italic>(a polypod fern) cp genome, such as five missing tRNA genes and two major rearranged regions. These common characters probably derive from their common ancestor. In the <italic>Alsophila </italic>cp genome, a highly repeated 565-bp-region, which is composed of tandem iterations of 11 similar segments, occurs at one endpoint of an ancient inversion, but it is not detected in the genome of <italic>Adiantum</italic>. Nonetheless, the origin and function of these repeats remain to be characterized in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Genome sequencing and assembly</title><p>Young leaves of <italic>Alsophila spinulosa </italic>were collected from a plant growing in the greenhouse in Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A voucher specimen was deposited at Wuhan Botanical Garden. Total DNA was extracted using the CTAB-based method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The cp genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In brief, the coding sequences were extracted from known chloroplast genomic sequences of three ferns [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_003386">NC_003386</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_008829">NC_008829</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_004766">NC_004766</ext-link>], three bryophytes [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_001319">NC_001319</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_005087">NC_005087</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_004543">NC_004543</ext-link>] and one lycophyte [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_006861">NC_006861</ext-link>] according to their annotations in GenBank. PCR primers were developed from alignments of the above coding sequences. Overlapping regions of each pair of adjacent PCR fragments exceeded 150 bp. We did not clone two inverted repeats (IRs) separately, but designed primers to amplify the regions spanning the junctions of LSC/IRA, LSC/IRB, SSC/IRA and SSC/IRB. Using these primers, we covered the entire cp genome of <italic>Alsophila </italic>with PCR products ranging in size from 500 bp to 5 kb. All PCR reactions were performed using TaKaRa LA taq (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan). Amplified cp genome fragments were cloned into TaKaRa pMD19-T plasmids (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan), which were then used to transform <italic>E. coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1;. Multiple (&#x02265; 6) clones were randomly selected and commercially sequenced using ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For long fragments (&#x0003e; 1.4 kb), walking primers were designed based on acquired sequences and used for sequencing remaining sequences step by step. Gap regions (caused by unsuccessful PCR amplification or failed primer walking sequencing) were amplified using primers that flank the gaps, then cloned and sequenced as above. From the individual reads we excluded vector, primer and low-quality sequences, then we assembled the reads using Phrap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Since automated assembly methods cannot distinguish two IRs, we input the reads as two parts and acquired two large contigs, with each contig including one IR and its adjacent partial large and small single copy (LSC and SSC) regions. Then the two large contigs were manually assembled into the complete circular genome sequence. Inverted repeats were identified through alignment of the final complete genome sequence against itself via Blast 2 sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].
