They all contain the standard fungal mitochondrial gene set, plus <italic>rnpB</italic>, the gene encoding the RNA subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P (mtP-RNA) and <italic>rps3</italic>, encoding ribosomal protein S3 (the latter lacking in <italic>R.oryzae</italic>). The mtP-RNAs of <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and of additional zygomycete relatives have the most eubacteria-like RNA structures among fungi. Precise mapping of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini of the <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> mtP-RNAs confirms their expression and processing at the exact sites predicted by secondary structure modeling. The 3&#x02032; RNA processing of zygomycete mitochondrial mRNAs, SSU-rRNA and mtP-RNA occurs at the C-rich sequence motifs similar to those identified in fission yeast and basidiomycete mtDNAs. The C-rich motifs are included in the mature transcripts, and are likely generated by exonucleolytic trimming of RNA 3&#x02032; termini. Zygomycete mtDNAs feature a variety of insertion elements: (i) mtDNAs of <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> were subject to invasions by double hairpin elements; (ii) genes of all three species contain numerous mobile group I introns, including one that is closest to an intron that invaded angiosperm mtDNAs; and (iii) at least one additional case of a mobile element, characterized by a homing endonuclease insertion between partially duplicated genes [Paquin,B., Laforest,M.J., Forget,L., Roewer,I., Wang,Z., Longcore,J. and Lang,B.F. (1997) Curr. Genet., 31, 380&#x02013;395]. The combined mtDNA-encoded proteins contain insufficient phylogenetic signal to demonstrate monophyly of zygomycetes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fungi constitute a huge group of highly diverse organisms, including some of the most-studied and best-understood eukaryotic model systems: &#x02018;baker's yeast&#x02019; (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>), and the filamentous euascomycetes <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>. These species all belong to the Ascomycota. Substantially fewer scientific studies have been performed in members of the sister phylum Basidiomycota and very little is known in the remaining two phyla, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota, often classified as &#x02018;lower fungi&#x02019;. This expression is a taxonomically vague concept borrowed from Aristotle's philosophy, visioning directed evolution from the simple (primitive, low) to the highly complex. The misnomer is most evident in the &#x02018;higher&#x02019; ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, which evolve toward microscopic, unicellular and genetically simplified yeast-like organisms in some lineages, and toward morphologically complex, gene-rich and biochemically versatile multicellular organisms in others.</p><p>Although the availability of complete nuclear and mitochondrial sequences of more than a dozen ascomycetes provides a strong basis for biochemical investigations, only a few complete mitochondrial sequences are known from chytrids, and none from zygomycetes, a situation that has motivated the work presented here. In fact, the number of zygomycete nuclear gene sequences (mostly rRNA sequences) is so limited that it is impossible to determine with confidence whether or not Zygomycota is a monophyletic taxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The lack of resolution in these analyses is consistent with estimates that even the combined LSU- and SSU-rRNA would contain far too little information to resolve many fungal phylogenetic relationships with confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). This dataset is at most sufficient for resolving fungal inferences below the phylum level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>Sequences of complete mtDNAs from several zygomycetes might be a first step in remediating this situation. Mitochondrial phylogenies can be based on up to 13 protein sequences, and have been shown to resolve deep divergences in the fungal and animal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). For instance, Alexopolous <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) indicate that &#x02018;additional study is needed to determine whether the class (Trichomycetes) is a monophyletic group belonging to Zygomycota, or merely a collection of orders grouped together on the basis of a unique shared habitat&#x02019;. Molecular phylogenies based on rRNA sequences were successful in moving the order Amoebidiales away from zygomycetes, although they were then placed with mesomycetozoan rotists, whose phylogenetic affiliation was unresolved and controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Only subsequent analysis with multiple mitochondrial proteins placed this group at the base of the animal divergence, with high confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This example clearly illustrates the requirement of multi-gene datasets with at least several thousand amino acid positions, for resolution of trees at the kingdom level.</p><p>Furthermore, zygomycete mtDNAs are of considerable interest for comparative gene expression studies: our preliminary data indicated the presence of a mitochondrial <italic>rnpB</italic> gene, which encodes the RNA subunit of RNase P, the enzymatically active part of an endonuclease (ribonucleo-protein) responsible for tRNA maturation. In mitochondria, the size and sequence of the RNA subunit varies substantially, which has considerably complicated its identification. The gene is apparently absent from all completely sequenced basidiomycete and chytridiomycete mtDNAs, and has a patchy distribution in ascomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>); to date, there are no published data on zygomycete mitochondrial RNase P (mtP-RNA).</p><p>To help remediate the lack of data for phylogenetic inferences, and to facilitate biochemical investigations and comparative mitochondrial genome analyses, we have sequenced mtDNAs from three distantly related zygomycetes, the Mucorales <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, the Mortierellales <italic>Mortierella verticillata</italic> and the Harpellales <italic>Smittium culisetae</italic>. In this article, we compare their mitochondrial genomes (gene content, gene organization, genetic code and widely conserved 3&#x02032; RNA processing sites). We will then present secondary structure models and expression data for seven newly identified zygomycete mtP-RNAs. Finally, we will test whether or not zygomycetes are monophyletic, and provide evidence that the group I introns invasion of <italic>cox1</italic> gene in angiosperms originated in a zygomycete close to Rhizopus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p>The various zygomycete strains were obtained from Kerry O'Donnell (National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, Peoria, IL; NRRL), R.W.

Protein sequences from apocytochrome <italic>b</italic> (Cob), as well as 7 subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (Nad), 3 cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (Cox) subunits and 2 ATP synthetase (Atp) subunits were aligned with Muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), concatenated and trimmed with Gblocks [using default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>)] to remove ambiguously aligned regions. The resulting alignment contained 2890 aligned positions. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were inferred from this alignment using both PHYML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and IQPNNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>); ML bootstrap support was determined based on 100 replicates, using both programs. All phylogenies were inferred using the JTT amino acid substitution model and gamma distribution (&#x00393;) correction for variation of rates across sites.</p><p>Phylogenetic inference based on concatenated datasets can lead to tree reconstruction artefacts, such as long-branch attraction, resulting from differences in relative evolutionary rates between genes [sometimes referred to as the covarion-like behavior of different genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>)]. Ideally, during the ML tree search procedure, nuisance parameters, such as branch lengths and the &#x00393; distribution shape parameter (&#x003b1;), could be optimized separately for each gene; however, this method results in the estimation of many more parameters, potentially more than can be statistically justified. For this reason, we partitioned the dataset into four functional categories: Atp (253 positions), Cob (361 positions), Cox (876 positions) and Nad (1400 positions). The additional parameters included in this partitioned dataset were justified using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Using this partitioned dataset, a topology was inferred from this alignment using MrBayes, with branch lengths and &#x003b1; parameter unlinked across partitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In addition, an ML tree was determined from this partitioned dataset using an adaptation of the method of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). All possible tree topologies were generated, with constraints of groups that received at least 95% bootstrap support under ML, using both IQPNNI and PHYML (Supplementary Figure 1). Log-likelihoods were calculated separately for each partition using PHYML, under each of the topologies, and the sum over all partitions was calculated for each tree. The tree found to maximize the sum log-likelihood of the dataset was taken to be the ML tree (this method is referred to henceforth as separate analysis). Bootstrap support was also calculated using both of these methods, based on 100 replicates. Likelihood ratio tests were performed using genewise optimized site likelihoods, given the 99 tree topologies described in Supplementary Figure 1, and using Tree-Puzzle to generate sitewise likelihoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) along with CONSEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of closely related fungal, green algal and plant intronic open reading frames (ORFs) of the same <italic>cox1</italic> intron (for species names and GenBank accession nos, see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were carried out. Sequences were aligned using Muscle and trimmed with Gblocks, and the resulting alignment was manually refined. An ML phylogeny was inferred using IQPNNI, and ML bootstrap support was determined based on 100 replicates.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Genes in addition to the standard fungal set, <italic>rnpB</italic> and <italic>rps3</italic></title><p>The mitochondrial genomes of the zygomycetes <italic>R.oryzae</italic> (previously listed incorrectly as <italic>R.stolonifer</italic>), <italic>M.verticillata</italic> and <italic>S.culisetae</italic> were completely sequenced. Like most other fungal mtDNAs, they map as circular molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), although they are most likely organized as linear multimeric concatamers <italic>in vivo</italic>, as in other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). mtDNAs of the three species carry the basic fungal set of genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and encode a full set of tRNAs [only <italic>trnI</italic>(cau) is absent in <italic>R.oryzae</italic>], the RNA component of mitochondrial RNase P (<italic>rnpB</italic>) and a ribosomal protein (<italic>rps3</italic>; lacking in <italic>R.oryzae</italic>). MtDNA-encoded <italic>rps3</italic> has previously been identified in several ascomycetes and in one chytridiomycete (<italic>Allomyces macrogynus</italic>; Blastocladiales), but not in other chytridiomycete orders, including Monoblepharidales, Spizellomycetales and Chytridiales. It has been proposed that this gene has been lost independently three times from opisthokont mitochondrial genomes: in the chytridiomycete lineage, in the animal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and now also in one of the three zygomycetes presented here. We assume that, in all cases, <italic>rps3</italic> has been transferred to the nuclear genome, like other ribosomal protein genes missing in fungal mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The sizes of zygomycete mtDNAs are within a close range of 54&#x02013;58 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Genes are encoded on both strands, but are not as tightly packed as in animals and some ascomycetes: only 40.6% in <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, 43.1% in <italic>M.verticillata</italic> and 35.3% in <italic>S.culisetae</italic> are coding. Nonetheless, the coding regions of <italic>nad2/nad3</italic> and <italic>nad4L/nad5</italic> of <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, respectively, overlap by 1 nt (i.e. the last nucleotide position of the UAA stop codon of the upstream gene is the first nucleotide of the AUG start codon of the downstream gene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). No conservation of mitochondrial gene order is observed between these species.</p></sec><sec><title>First steps toward a derived genetic code in zygomycetes</title><p>Both <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and the fast-evolving <italic>S.culisetae</italic> have retained the standard translation code for protein coding genes, a trait inherited from the eubacterial ancestors of mitochondria. However, <italic>M.verticillata</italic> reassigns two UGA &#x02018;stop&#x02019; codons as tryptophan, once each in <italic>nad3</italic> and <italic>nad4</italic>. UGA(Trp) codons are also present in the <italic>S.culisetae</italic> intronic ORF283 and ORF248, both encoding group I introns homing endonucleases of the LAGLI-DADG type. UGA(Trp) at amino acid position 237 of ORF248 is part of a distinctive, highly conserved sequence motif of this class of endonuclease, strongly suggesting its translation as tryptophan. It is possible that the presence of this UGA(Trp) is a vestige of horizontal intron transfer from a fungus adapted to this translation code. In fact, according to our phylogenetic analyses of intron endonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), <italic>S.culisetae</italic> ORF248 is closely related to ORF313 of <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>, which makes preferential use of UGA(Trp) in its genes and intronic ORFs. Like in the fission yeast <italic>S.pombe</italic> and the basidiomycete <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic>, the mtDNAs of <italic>S.culisetae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> do not encode <italic>trnW</italic>(uca), which would efficiently recognize both UGA and UGG tryptophan codons. We assume that in all these cases, UGA codons are (albeit inefficiently) decoded by <italic>trnW</italic>(cca) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). However, it cannot be excluded that, alternatively, the C in the wobble position of the anticodon is either modified or partially edited to allow efficient recognition of UGA(Trp) codons.</p><p>The zygomycete mtDNAs described here encode complete sets of tRNAs sufficient to recognize all encountered codons (for codon usage, see Supplementary Table 1S). <italic>R.oryzae</italic> does not have <italic>trnI</italic>(cau); however, ATA(Ile) codons are absent in standard mitochondrial genes, although they occur in intronic ORFs. Incidentally, a strikingly similar scenario exists in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces octosporus</italic>. It has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) that either (i) the tRNA required for translation of ATA(Ile) is imported from the cytoplasm to recognize these codons or (ii) the intronic ORFs are neither translated nor required for intron splicing. A further explanation is that these codon positions are recognized by other tRNAs at low efficiency, resulting in amino acid misincorporation, which might be permissible at poorly conserved amino acid positions of proteins.</p><p>Whatever the mechanism of codon recognition, we suggest that such unexpected codon usage in intronic ORFs reflects horizontal intron transfer from species that are adapted to the use of UGA(Trp) and/or ATA(Ile). This codon usage is common in fungi and several other eukaryotic lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Eubacteria-like mtP-RNAs in zygomycete mitochondria</title><p>Mitochondrial <italic>rnpB</italic> genes (encoding the mitochondrial RNA subunit of RNase P, mtP-RNA) were identified by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis in all three zygomycetes using the previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), and their RNA secondary structures were modeled by phylogenetic comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/People/lang/rnpB/"/>). The presence of this gene in all three zygomycetes is striking, because outside fungi, <italic>rnpB</italic> is only present in the green alga <italic>Nephroselmis olivacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and in various jakobids (B. F. Lang and E. Seif, unpublished data), including <italic>Reclinomonas americana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Within fungi, it is only present in some ascomycetes, but absent in basidiomycetes and chytridiomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The inferred size of the <italic>S.culisetae</italic> mtP-RNA is 145 nt, close to the shortest known example (140 nt, in <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Most remarkably, the highly reduced mtP-RNA structures of <italic>S.culisetae</italic> and budding yeasts are almost identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), perfectly matching the minimum consensus secondary structure of fungal mtP-RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In contrast, <italic>rnpB</italic> from <italic>M.verticillata</italic> and <italic>R.oryzae</italic> are the largest genes of this class ever identified (980 and 830 bp, respectively), even larger than <italic>rnpB</italic> genes studied in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In addition, the zygomycete mitochondrial RNA secondary structures are the most bacteria-like among fungi.</p><p>To verify the expression of the <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> genes, we determined their precise 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends by sequencing RT&#x02013;PCR products of circularized mtP-RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The 3&#x02032; end of <italic>M.verticillata</italic> is 9 nt longer than anticipated, elongated by a cytidine-rich stretch of sequence. A similar extension is located at the 3&#x02032; terminus of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces octosporus</italic> mtP-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and downstream of protein coding genes in a variety of fungi (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The 5&#x02032; end of <italic>M.verticillata</italic>, and both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini of <italic>R.oryzae</italic> mtP-RNAs, match the proposed secondary structure model and reveal little heterogeneity of mtP-RNA termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In evolutionary terms, zygomycete mtP-RNA structures cover an unprecedented wide range of intermediate stages in loss of RNA structural elements. The mtP-RNAs from <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and closely related species have the most bacteria-like secondary structures, containing almost all structural elements of the bacterial minimum secondary structure consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). They are followed by <italic>M.verticillata</italic>, whose structure closely resembles the more derived mtP-RNA of the ascomycete <italic>Taphrina deformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Finally, the tiny, yeast-like mtP-RNA molecule of <italic>S.culisetae</italic> has no P2 helix, which is otherwise almost omnipresent in mtP-RNAs. Note that this helix is also absent in <italic>M.verticillata</italic>, potentially indicating its loss in a common ancestor.</p><p>The most bacteria-like fungal mtP-RNA secondary structure is that of <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, only lacking P13, P14 and P19, which are otherwise only present in the protist mtP-RNAs of <italic>N.olivacea</italic> and <italic>R.americana</italic>. The large size of the <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> mtP-RNAs is due to insertions at the J5-15 and J5-18 junctions, respectively, and in the P12 helix. In order to determine whether these regions are conserved structural elements or more variable insertion elements or introns, we amplified the cDNA sequence of the <italic>R.oryzae</italic> mtP-RNA, and the genomic sequences from the closely related Mucorales <italic>M.mucedo</italic>, <italic>R.spectabilis</italic>, <italic>R.oligosporus</italic> and <italic>R.stolonifer</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the insertion sequences can be folded into double hairpin structures [DHEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>)]. Because the cDNA sequence of the <italic>R.oryzae</italic> mtP-RNA is identical to the genomic sequence, these variable regions are not introns. Furthermore, the insertion points and sizes of these regions vary substantially, indicating that they have been acquired recently and independently. Their presence in mtP-RNAs pinpoints structural regions that are likely not critical for RNase P activity. An analogous situation has been described in some cyanobacteria, where P-RNAs contain short tandem repeats that increase the length of helix P12. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown that this helix is not required for catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, implying that it is also unlikely to be crucial for the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved C-rich motifs in mRNAs and SSU-rRNA</title><p>Small C-rich clusters are present downstream of mitochondrial protein- and SSU-rRNA coding regions, in all three species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The consensus sequence of this motif varies only slightly among zygomycetes. It also exists in basidiomycetes and in fission yeasts, pointing to a shared function. Mapping of the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>M.verticillata</italic> mtP-RNA (which also terminates with this motif as discussed above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), of <italic>cox1</italic> and the SSU-rRNA of <italic>R.oryzae</italic> shows that these C-rich motifs are the site of 3&#x02032; RNA processing, and are retained in the mature RNA molecules. The presence of ragged 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that these are generated by an exonuclease trimming mechanism. Similar observations have been made in fission yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This mechanism resembles that of nuclear and viral RNAs terminating in polyuridine motifs that serve as a binding site for the La protein implicated in RNA protection against exonucleases [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>); homologs of La are known from a range of fungi and animals].</p></sec><sec><title>More instances of mobile endonuclease elements?</title><p>As reported earlier, the chytridiomycete fungus <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> has a novel mtDNA insertion element whose sequence is absent in a close relative, <italic>Allomyces arbusculus</italic>. This element consists of a duplicate C-terminus of a foreign <italic>atp6</italic> gene, plus an ORF encoding an endonuclease that is responsible for its mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The inserted <italic>atp6</italic> portion is fused in phase with the resident gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), reconstituting an obviously functional hybrid gene of standard length and amino acid conservation. In fact, it has been shown that homing endonucleases can be mobile even independent of introns and genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), and that they are capable of carrying genetic material from one site to another when they migrate.</p><p>Intriguingly, similar gene hybrids are present in the mtDNAs of <italic>R.oryzae</italic> (<italic>atp9*-C</italic>) and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> (<italic>cox2*-C</italic>), including ORF376 (<italic>R.oryzae</italic>) and ORF342 (<italic>M.verticillata</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). ORF342 has no significant similarity to known endonucleases, but ORF376, like the mobile element endonuclease of <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), encodes a protein related to homing endonucleases of the GIY-YIG type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The same structural organization is seen in the <italic>atp6-ORF360-atp6*-C</italic> gene region in <italic>A.macrogynus</italic>, <italic>atp9-ORF376-atp9*-C</italic> in <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and <italic>cox2</italic>-<italic>ORF342</italic>-<italic>cox2*-C</italic> in <italic>M.verticillata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating the presence of similar mobile elements. However, contrary to the <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> case, we currently do not have biochemical evidence for the endonucleolytic activity. Both the <italic>cox2*-C</italic> and <italic>atp9*-C</italic> fragments of the two zygomycetes encode C-terminal ends that are 100% identical at the amino acid level, suggesting that the source of potential transfers are closely related zygomycete species.</p></sec><sec><title>Lateral transfer of a group I intron from zygomycete to angiosperm mitochondria</title><p>A significant portion of the genomes described here is occupied by introns (<italic>R.oryzae</italic> 15.8%; <italic>M.verticillata</italic> 8.6%; and <italic>S.culisetae</italic> 27.4%). With 14 introns, the mtDNA of <italic>S.culisetae</italic> contains the largest number, 9 of which are located in the <italic>cox1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Here, all the identified zygomycete introns are of group I and 22 contain intronic ORFs: sixteen of the LAGLI-DADG type and six of the GIY-YIG type. In <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, we identified one intron [<italic>cox1</italic>-i1(ORF305)], which is most similar to introns inserted at the same positions of angiosperm <italic>cox1</italic> genes (highest BLAST expect value of e<sup>&#x02212;114</sup> with <italic>Philodendron oxycardium</italic>, <italic>Lamium</italic> sp. and <italic>Malpighia glabra</italic>). Because this is the only group I intron in vascular plant mtDNAs, it has most likely been acquired by lateral transfer. The hypothesis of recent horizontal transfer of this intron from a fungal donor to flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) is further based on the incongruence between the intron and organismal phylogenies, and its closer phylogenetic relationship to a fungal intron than to those of <italic>Marchantia</italic> and <italic>Prototheca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). However, because of the high mobility of this intron and the possibility of multiple lateral transfers, the published phylogenetic inferences have to be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The presence of additional, highly similar introns in three fungi, <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, <italic>S.culisetae</italic> (this paper) and <italic>Monoblepharella</italic>15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), allows us to more rigorously test the hypothesis of Vaughn <italic>et al</italic>. by phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Our analysis reveals that ORFs from <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, <italic>Monoblepharella</italic>15 and the three angiosperms group together with high support (98%). ORF305 from <italic>R.oryzae</italic> is the closest and most similar relative of the angiosperm ORFs, suggesting that the fungal donor of the group I intron and its resident ORF was a zygomycete. This scenario is biologically meaningful, because symbiotic mycorrhizal zygomycetes live in close association with most plants. However, note that ORF248 from <italic>S.culisetae</italic> branches with ORF313 from <italic>P.anserina</italic>. This observation, along with the presence of a UGA codon specifying tryptophan in ORF248 (see above), suggests a second case of lateral transfer, this time from a euascomycete close to <italic>P.anserina</italic>, into a zygomycete.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis with standard mitochondrial proteins: are zygomycetes paraphyletic?</title><p>The availability of complete mtDNAs from three distant zygomycetes provides an opportunity for testing the monophyly of Zygomycota. Tree topologies were inferred from a 2890 position concatenated protein alignment using two standard ML-based methods, MrBayes and separate ML analysis. The results of these analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, which presents the tree produced by IQPNNI, along with bootstrap values from all methods. All methods produced similar results, except that separate analysis recovered monophyly of <italic>S.culisetae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> (81% bootstrap support). The latter topology was also found in the &#x02018;credible set&#x02019; in three independent runs of MrBayes (5.3, 44.7 and 99.0% posterior probability, respectively; MrBayes bootstrap support for this grouping was 45%). Although these data support both of these topologies, it is interesting that the monophyly of <italic>S.culisetae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> is better supported under more sophisticated (yet statistically valid) models.</p><p>Although this phylogeny is generally robust, bootstrap support values indicate two major areas of uncertainty: the position of <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> and the relative branching positions of the zygomycetes. Indeed, also the approximately unbiased likelihood ratio test suggests these same problems. When sitewise likelihoods are calculated separately for each functional class, the confidence set contained a total of 17 tree topologies that failed to reject the data (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Among these topologies, <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> branches immediately above, immediately below or monophyletic with the chytridiomycetes, and <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> are found to be either monophyletic or paraphyletic (with either species branching more deeply than the other). Although <italic>S.culisetae</italic> and <italic>M.verticillata</italic> are monophyletic in the best tree under this model of separately optimized functional classes, all topologies in which all three zygomycetes are monophyletic are rejected. It is worth noting that several obvious wrong positions for <italic>S.culisetae</italic> were also observed (e.g. as most ancestral among fungi, or among the chytridiomycetes), suggesting that the accelerated evolutionary rate in this species causes a long-branch attraction artefact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Similar results are obtained when sitewise likelihoods were calculated from the fully concatenated alignment. Clearly, these data are insufficient to resolve the phylogeny of the zygomycetes, most likely because these three species diverge deeply within fungi, and at relatively short distance from each other. In such a situation, two strategies can be used to resolve the dilemma, addition of more zygomycete and neighboring fungal lineages or addition of more sequence per species. As our protein dataset is already based on complete mtDNAs, this latter strategy implies resorting to expressed sequence tag and/or nuclear genome sequences, a currently ongoing project.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

Positions in red are invariant in the minimum bacterial consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>); uppercase letters in the mtP-RNAs indicate 100%, lowercase 90%, conservation of the minimum bacterial consensus sequence. The arrows pinpoint experimentally determined termini; arrow length is proportional to the percentage of molecules ending at a defined position. Double hairpin elements are named in green.

The 3&#x02032; termini of the <italic>R.oryzae</italic> mitochondrial SSU rRNA and of <italic>cox1</italic> mRNA were determined by nuclease S1 assays and run on a sequencing gel against a commercial 10 bp ladder (Invitrogen 10821-015) that was 3&#x02032; labeled with ddATP (<sup>32</sup>P). For experimental details see Materials and Methods. The positions of 3&#x02032; termini for both molecules are indicated in the derived consensus sequences by arrows. A small fraction of the undigested form of the SSU rRNA probe is apparent on the gel. In the lower part of the figure, additional, similar motifs in fissions yeasts and basidiomycetes are presented. Uppercase letters indicate 100% conservation and lowercase letters correspond to at least 60% nucleotide conservation. Lowercase Cs between brackets indicate the C-clusters of variable length.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki199f3"/></fig><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Schematic view of atp6 regions of <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> and <italic>A.arbusculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), atp9 of <italic>R.oryzae</italic> and cox2 of <italic>M.verticillata</italic>.

Phylogenies were inferred from the resulting 2890 character alignment using four different methods. Shown here is the ML tree inferred using IQPNNI, along with bootstrap support values from PHYML, IQPNNI, MrBayes and separate ML analysis, in order from top to bottom, based on 100 replicates. Nodes with 100% bootstrap support using all methods are indicated by an &#x02018;asterisk&#x02019;. Clearly, both the position of <italic>A.macrogynus</italic> and the branching order of the zygomycetes remain unclear, although the topology is robust overall. (<bold>B</bold>) Phylogeny of intronic ORFs. Sequences of intronic ORFs inserted in <italic>cox1</italic> genes were obtained from the following species: ORF305 from <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, ORF248 from <italic>S.culisetae</italic>, ORF318 from <italic>Monoblepharella</italic>15 (NP_803527), ORF333 from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic> (NP_705621), ORF317 from <italic>S.octosporus</italic> (NP_700369), ORF313 from <italic>P.anserina</italic> (NP_074934), ORF319 from <italic>Pichia canadensis</italic> (NP_038209), ia4 from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (AAB21126), ORF251 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (T07187), ORF234.2 <italic>Prototheca wickerhamii</italic> (NP_042245), ORF280 from <italic>Peperomia obtusifolia</italic> (AAB86934), ORF279 from <italic>Veronica catenata</italic> (CAA11340) and ORF277 from <italic>Maranta leuconeura</italic> (CAA11350). Sequences were aligned as described in Materials and Methods, and a phylogeny was inferred by ML. Only bootstrap support values &#x0003e;50% are shown. This tree robustly supports the monophyly between sequences from <italic>Monoblepharella</italic>15, <italic>R.oryzae</italic>, and the angiosperms, strongly suggesting horizontal intron transfer between these two groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki199f5"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of gene, ORF and intron content in zygomycete mtDNAs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Genes and introns</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">R.oryzae</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">M.verticillata</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">S.culisetae</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">rns, rnl</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">atp6,8,9</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">cob, cox1,2,3</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">nad1-6,4L</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">trnA-W</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">24 [<italic>trnI</italic> (cau) missing]</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">26</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">27</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">rnpB</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">rps3</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025a1;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#x025aa;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Group I introns (intronic ORFs)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">9(5)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4(3)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">14(13)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Intron locations (number)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>cox1</italic>(3), <italic>cox2</italic>(1) <italic>cox3</italic>(1), <italic>cob</italic>(2) <italic>nad3</italic>(1), <italic>atp9</italic>(1)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>cox1</italic>(3), <italic>cox3</italic>(1)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>rnl</italic>(1), <italic>cox1</italic>(9) <italic>cox2</italic>(1), <italic>cob</italic>(3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Other ORFs</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">7</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
