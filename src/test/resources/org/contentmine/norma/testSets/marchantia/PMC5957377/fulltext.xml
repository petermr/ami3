Functionally active CLO/PXG proteins with roles in abiotic stress tolerance and lipid droplet storage are present in some Trebouxiophycean and Chlorophycean green algae but are absent from the small number of sequenced Prasinophyceaen genomes. <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes are expressed during dehydration stress in Charophyte algae, a sister clade of the land plants (Embryophyta). <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like sequences are also present in all of the &#x0003e;300 sequenced Embryophyte genomes, where some species contain as many as 10&#x02013;12 genes that have arisen via selective gene duplication. Angiosperm genomes harbour at least one copy each of two distinct CLO/PX isoforms, termed H (high) and L (low), where H-forms contain an additional C-terminal motif of about 30&#x02013;50 residues that is absent from L-forms. In contrast, species in other Viridiplantae taxa, including green algae, non-vascular plants, ferns and gymnosperms, contain only one (or occasionally both) of these isoforms per genome. Transcriptome and biochemical data show that <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes have complex patterns of developmental and tissue-specific expression. CLO/PXG proteins can associate with cytosolic lipid droplets and/or bilayer membranes. Many of the analysed isoforms also have peroxygenase activity and are involved in oxylipin metabolism. The distribution of <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes is consistent with an origin &#x0003e;1 billion years ago in at least two of the earliest diverging groups of the Viridiplantae, namely the Chlorophyta and the Streptophyta, after the Viridiplantae had already diverged from other Archaeplastidal groups such as the Rhodophyta and Glaucophyta. While algal CLO/PXGs have roles in lipid packaging and stress responses, the Embryophyte proteins have a much wider spectrum of roles and may have been instrumental in the colonisation of terrestrial habitats and the subsequent diversification as the major land flora.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was made possible by support from the University of South Wales, UK, Malaysian Palm Oil Board, and Atomic Energy Commission of Syria.

In this study we have analysed a well-conserved gene family, which is normally annotated in databases as &#x02018;caleosin&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;peroxygenase&#x02019;, with the aim of tracing the evolution, expression patterns and functional roles of the encoded proteins in plants. In terms of their functional description, the caleosin/peroxygenases (CLO/PXG) are members of the EC:1.11.2.3 class of oxidoreductases, Pfam reference PF05042. However, the CLO/PXGs also have much broader biological functions and are present in the majority of Viridiplantae taxa for which sequence and/or biochemical data are currently available [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Viridiplantae, which include all of the land plants and green algae are divided into two groups, namely the Streptophyta (Charophyta + Embryophyta) and the Chlorophyta (a highly diverse group of green algae including the Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Prasinophyceae)[<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While CLO/PXGs appear to be ubiquitous in all land plant (Embryophyta) genomes, they are present in some, but by no means all, algal taxa within the Charophyta and Chlorophyta[<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CLO/PXGs are also found in many fungal taxa but are absent from other the major Opisthokont clades, including animals [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The proteins encoded by <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes are relatively small (typically 25&#x02013;30 kDa) and contain a highly conserved single calcium-binding EF hand motif, a lipid-binding domain and two invariant heme-coordinating histidine residues [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, there is a region containing several predicted kinase sites proximal to the C terminus [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These features make up the canonical motifs that are used to classify CLO/PXG proteins. We and others have previously shown that some CLO/PXG isoforms from both plants and fungi can bind to a variety of cellular bilayer membranes, including ER and plasmalemma, via a single transmembrane domain [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has also been shown that other CLO/PXG isoforms bind to the phospholipid monolayer membrane that surrounds intracellular lipid droplets (LDs), possibly via a conserved proline-rich motif [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is possible that some CLO/PXG isoforms can bind both to bilayer membranes and LDs, as has been demonstrated with other lipid-binding proteins [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Experimental studies in several labs have confirmed that CLO/PXGs from both plants and fungi can act as calcium-binding proteins that have specific types of lipid peroxygenase (PXG) activities that require the presence of the heme groups coordinated by two invariant histidine residues [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This lipid peroxygenase activity is commonly associated with epoxy fatty acid biosynthesis as part of overall oxylipin metabolism in plants [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] as well as a broader series of epoxidation, hydroxylation and aromatization activities on substrates including terpenes and acyl derivatives [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In view of their multifunctional roles and database annotations as both &#x02018;caleosins&#x02019; and &#x02018;peroxygenases&#x02019;, we will refer to these genes/proteins as <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> and CLO/PXG respectively.</p><p>To date, only a relatively small fraction of the many hundreds of plant and fungal genes that are currently annotated as &#x02018;caleosin&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;peroxygenase&#x02019; in public databases, such as NCBI or Ensembl Plant, have been shown to encode proteins with experimentally proven PXG activity. Moreover, our detailed manual curation of these annotated genes and their derived protein sequences has shown that in some cases these putative CLO/PXG-like sequences lack critical residues known to be involved in key biological functions of the proteins, such as calcium binding, heme coordination or membrane attachment. One of the unusual features of CLO/PXG proteins is that, in addition to often being active enzymes, they can also have important structural roles in cytosolic LDs where they are the second most highly abundant components (after oleosins) in the LD proteome [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Indeed, CLO/PXGs have been shown to play important structural roles in facilitating the assembly, stabilisation, storage and turnover of LDs in a range of plant tissues from leaves and seeds to pollen grains and even in individual algal cells [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Experimental studies and transcriptional data have implicated CLO/PXGs in a wide range of physiological functions in plants, including a host of processes in vegetative tissues of plants and algae. These physiological processes include drought and osmotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], pathogen responses [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], toxin sequestration [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], stomatal regulation, water transpiration, seed germination and G protein signalling [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], nitrogen deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and adaptation to darkness [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Of particular interest was whether separate CLO/PXG isoforms are involved in the mainly LD-associated structural functions as compared the peroxygenase functions of the proteins, which tend to be associated with bilayer membranes rather than LDs. To achieve this we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the &#x0003e;1300 CLO/PXG-related sequences from Viridiplantae species that are currently lodged in public databases. The primary aim of this analysis was to establish a robust phylogeny and to explore the possible evolution of plant CLO/PXGs over the past &#x0003e;1 billion years. Alongside this analysis, we analysed the transcriptional profiles of <italic>CLO/PXGs</italic> in two unpublished monocot (palm) species in addition to analysing profiles from other species that were obtained from public databases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Transcriptional analyses</title><p>Date palm (<italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic> L.) seeds were collected from fruits of the Sukary cultivar, imported from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Seeds were isolated, washed, air-dried and stored in plastic bags at room temperature until required. Seeds were then germinated <italic>in vitro</italic> in a current of running water for two weeks before planting in culture boxes placed in an incubator at 30 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C and humidified daily and seedlings were obtained 15 days after sowing. Seedlings with a radicle length of 0.5 or 2 or 4.5 cm were referred as stage I, II and III, respectively. For stress experiments, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD dissolved in toluene at 10 &#x003bc;g mL<sup>-1</sup>, purity 99%) was purchased from Supelco Inc., USA. TCDD was placed in a 10 mL capped glass tube and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. For health and environmental safety reasons, residual TCDD was re-dissolved in a minimum volume (100 &#x003bc;L) of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 5 mL of aqueous solutions of TCDD were prepared in deionized and distilled water to obtain initial concentrations of 0, 10, 50 and 100 ng L<sup>-1</sup> TCDD. For treatment of seeds with TCDD, seeds were germinated as described above and humidified daily with the prepared solutions of TCDD at various concentrations. Seedlings at stages 0, I, II and III were taken for further analysis. For drought stress, seedlings were pre-treated with water for 2, 4 and 6 days under the culture conditions described above. Osmotic stress was achieved by irrigating seedlings with water at concentrations of 150 and 300 mg L<sup>-1</sup> NaCl at each development stage.</p><p>Changes in relative transcriptional abundance of genes encoding LD-associated proteins in response to TCDD exposure were analyzed by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Briefly, frozen fine powder (1 g) samples from whole seedlings at stages 0, I, II and III were used to extract total RNA using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The quality of extracted RNAs was checked on agarose gels and concentrations measured by a Nanodrop device. Remaining traces of genomic DNA were digested by DNase I and the lack of trace genomic DNA in total RNA was confirmed by a control PCR using total RNA as the template. Aliquots of 1 &#x003bc;g total RNA were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis according to Hanano et al (2014). Real-time and qPCRs were performed as described by Hanano et al (2014) and primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196669.s006">S1 Table</xref>. The relative expression of target genes was normalized using two reference genes <italic>Act-1</italic> and <italic>Tub-&#x003b2;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Each measurement was performed in triplicate together with a dilution series of the reference gene. PCR efficiencies were between 95% and 105% (data not shown) and the average of <italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> was taken. The relative quantification RQ of target genes was calculated directly using software from the qPCR system. Sequences of amplified regions were confirmed by sequencing on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer using a Big Dye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>Oil palm transcriptome analysis was carried out according to [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The oil palm genome P5-build was used to read map the RNA seq data from Roche 454 reads (a full dataset is available from NCBI BioProject PRJNA201497). Briefly, reads from Roche/454-derived libraries were assembled into isotigs, which were blasted onto <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> gene models with a threshold of <italic>E</italic>-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. The best-hit <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> gene model was assigned to the homologue of the query isotig. To estimate expression levels of genes in mesocarp and kernel tissues, Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads from each library were mapped to assembled isotigs from all <italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> reads by using the Burrows&#x02013;Wheeler Aligner. Gene group expression levels were calculated as the number of mapped reads on each isotig divided by the total number of isotigs, multiplied by 100,000, and scaled by the number of genes in each gene group.

It should be noted that although this list is annotated as &#x02018;plant seed peroxygenase&#x02019;, the source tissue list shows that the relevant <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes are expressed throughout the plant and not just in seeds. We found that some of the putative <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes in the various public genome databases were present as incomplete or partial sequences with missing and/or corrupted versions of the major canonical CLO/PXG domains known to be essential for protein function. Such sequences, which may be from non-functional pseudogenes, were normally discarded in our analysis although several examples were included to illustrate points of gene expansion as discussed below.

The motifs are numbered 1 to 7 in order of their motif score, which reflects their length and their extent of conservation across all the species analysed. The distribution of these motifs beginning at the N terminus of CLO/PXG proteins was 4-1-7-6-2-5-3 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, the selected CLO/PXGs are grouped in eight distinctive taxonomic clades that represent the major Viridiplantae groups. In all cases these highly divergent plant groups show highly conserved organisation of the seven Motifs listed above. However, it should be noted that Motif 4, which is present in H-domain variants, is absent from at least one CLO/PXG sequence from all angiosperm species, i.e. Groups (vi), (vii) and (viii), and it is these Motif 4-lacking proteins that make up the L-isoforms of CLO/PXG [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Motif 4 is a 30&#x02013;50 residue domain present close to the N-terminus and is found in many CLO/PXG sequences throughout the Viridiplantae (and Fungi). This Motif is characteristic of the so-called H-caleosins (where H = high molecular weight), as previously reported from several labs [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We found that all Angiosperm genomes sequenced to date contain at least one copy each of the L- and H-caleosin sequences and although the evidence is less clear for the other Viridiplantae, it seems that most species also contain both isoforms. One reason for the existence of these two isoforms that are differentiated only by the 30&#x02013;50 residue N-terminal insertion may be found in their respective pI values. The H-isoforms have low pI values typically below 6 while the L-isoforms have values typically above 8, which indicates that they may function optimally in different subcellular compartments [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Motif 1 includes the canonical calcium binding EF hand domain as found in all CLO/PXG sequences in all species. Motifs 7 and 6 contain the proline-rich and lipid binding domains respectively, which are well conserved in the Viridiplantae. Although the MEME software identified Motifs 7 and 6 as separate features, they can probably be regarded functionally as a single well conserved lipid-binding motif due to the presence of the group of about 20 non-polar residues that make up the putative TM or LD-binding domain. Motif 2 includes heme-binding and kinase phosphorylation domains and includes a relatively lengthy 32-residue consensus sequence, <monospace>NIHKCKHGSDSGVYDTEGRFVPEKFEEIFSKY</monospace>, which we also found as a very highly conserved domain in most plant and fungal CLO/PXGs. Motif 5 is a shorter and weaker feature that is of unknown function. Motif 3 is a well-conserved C-terminal domain with a characteristic casein kinase phosphorylation box, DGSLFE, as reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the full version of Motif 3 includes a larger 27-residue consensus sequence, <monospace>LYWLCKDKDGFLHKETVRRCYDGSLFE</monospace>, which is relatively highly conserved across the Viridiplantae.</p><p>The transmembrane domain (TM) predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196669.s009">S4 Table</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196669.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) show the distribution of TM domains in each CLO/PXG sequence. Note that, since many CLO/PXG isoforms bind to LDs either instead of or in addition to bilayer membranes, these TM domains can be regarded as generalised lipid binding domains and not necessarily only involved in transmembrane functions. A single TM domain was present in each case except for five sequences where there were two TM domains. These five CLO/PXG sequences were ApCLO1 from Trebouxiophyceae, VcCLO1 and GpCLO1 from Chlorophyceae, SmCLO2 from lower plants and EgCLO3 from the monocot group. There were also six CLO/PXG sequences where no predicted TM domain was present, namely CrCLO2 from Chlorophyceae, MpCLO1 from lower plants, PdCLO4 from monocots, StCLO5, NtCLO5 and GmCLO5 from dicots. In all cases these were members of larger CLO/PXG families in each species and, since the predicted proteins had all the other features of CLO/PXGs, these may be non-lipid-binding, soluble isoforms.

The three alignments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g002">Fig 2</xref> demonstrate how <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> gene families can be relatively large and the encoded proteins rather diverse, even within a single species. This is consistent with transcriptome and functional evidence that different CLO/PXG proteins are found in different subcellular and tissue locations, are subject to different forms of regulation and also may have different types of enzymatic or structural activities in plants [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In the case of the alga <italic>K</italic>. <italic>nitens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), the major structural domains are conserved in all five isoforms and while there are large insertions in three of the isoforms, these do not affect the integrity of the key canonical domains. For example KNCLO1 has a 100+ residue extension at the N terminal, which has no similarity with any other published sequence, but the remainder of the protein is obviously a member of the CLO/PXG family.</p><p>The monocot <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> (japonica rice) genome contains 10 annotated CLO/PXG-like sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), not all of which are likely to be functional proteins. In particular, OsjCLO10 lacks the Ca<sup>+</sup>-, heme- and lipid- binding domains and contains a 150-residue insert at the N-terminus. This insert has some similarity with the missing CLO/PXG-like domains and may therefore be due to a transposition of part of the genomic sequence, most likely due to exon shuffling. In contrast, OsjCLO2 contains a 68-residue insert at the N-terminus with no homology to other database sequences but the remainder of the protein includes all the normal CLO/PXG motifs. Apart from these unusual sequences, the remaining 8 rice isoforms show the normal protein architecture although their H-domains are much less conserved compared to those of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> as discussed below. Transcriptome data show that 8 of the rice <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes are expressed in a wide variety of vegetative and reproductive tissues and are modulated by drought, salt and cold stresses [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>The model dicot species <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> contains 7 CLO/PXG isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). According to transcriptome data, all of the genes encoding these isoforms are expressed, although <italic>AtCLO7</italic> is only present at very low levels relative to the other 6 genes [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].

However, a more detailed inspection of the AtCLO7 sequence shows that the protein is not a true caleosin because it lacks critical motifs such as the Ca<sup>+</sup>-binding EF hand and the two heme-binding histidine residues. In comparison with the other six genes, <italic>AtCLO7</italic> is the least expressed and shows little or no response to environmental stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which means that it is probably a pseudogene. The other six sequences fall into two well-defined classes, namely the H-isoforms, AtCLO1, 2 &#x00026; 3 plus AtCLO8, and the L-isoforms, AtCLO4 &#x00026; 6.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses of a representative 67 CLO/PXG sequences from 34 species across the Viridiplantae are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. The sequences separate into four clearly distinct clusters that are labelled as follows: A) Chlorophyte and Streptophyte green algae, B) non-angiosperm Embryophytes; C) H-isoform angiosperms; and D) L-isoform angiosperms. This phylogeny supports the conclusion from the Motif analysis (see above) that H-caleosin isoforms are ancestral to the L-caleosin isoforms. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, the phylogenetic analysis has been extended to include sequences from six selected basal and advanced species that represent all of the major Fungal taxa as well as the 67 Viridiplantae sequences. The fungal sequences used were: <italic>A</italic>. <italic>flavus</italic> (AflCLO1); <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> (UmCLO1); <italic>R</italic>. <italic>allomycis</italic> (RaCLO1); <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cinereus</italic> (CcCLO1); <italic>R</italic>. <italic>irregularis</italic> (RiCLO1); and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>delemar</italic> (RdCLO1). Note that the CLO/PXG sequences for each of these very diverse fungal species that probably diverged from one another &#x0003e;1 billion years ago (Bya) [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] are located within a single branch of the green algal cluster and fall within the same group as the Trebouxiophyte, (shown as the yellow group A). This indicates that the fungal CLO/PXG sequences are more closely related to those of algae than to the land plants, which did not appear until after 500 million years ago (Mya), and the fungal CLO/PXGs may therefore have been derived from Trebouxiophyte algae. The origin, distribution and biological functions of fungal CLO/PXGs will be the subject of a subsequent paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Transcriptional analyses of CLO/PXG in date and oil palm</title><p>The oil palm genome contains six <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like sequences and a heatmap analysis of their expression patterns in 22 different tissue libraries is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g004">Fig 4A</xref>.

One of the characteristic features of higher plant CLO/PXGs is the occurrence of both H- and L- isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and this was found in at least one of the Chlorophyte species, <italic>Auxenochlorella protothecoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), which indicates that <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes had already diverged into the two isoforms at a very early stage of their evolution. Although genome sequence data are still much less complete in green algae compared with land plants, the available information enables us to trace the presence, and sometimes the absence of <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes in a way that allows some evolutionary inferences to be made.</p><p>The Chlorophyta are conventionally divided into four groups, namely Trebouxophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Ulvaphyceae and Prasinophyceae. There is good evidence for the Chlorophyceae being a monophyletic clade while the other three groups are highly paraphyletic[<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes are present in at least four species of Chlorophyceae (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, <italic>Gonium pectorale</italic>, <italic>Monoraphidium neglectum</italic> and <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>) and four species of Trebouxophyceae (<italic>Auxenochlorella protothecoides</italic>, <italic>Chlorella variabilis</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea</italic>). Furthermore, in at least five of these algal species the biological activity of these genes is supported by transcriptome and/or biochemical studies [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes appear to be absent from several other sequenced genomes in both the Chlorophyceae (e.g. <italic>Dunaliella</italic> and <italic>Haematococcus</italic> spp.) and Trebouxophyceae (e.g. <italic>Lobosphaera</italic> spp.) [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].

However, this does not necessarily mean that the <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> gene family is absent from other unsequenced members of these taxa. Overall, the most parsimonious interpretation of the currently available data is that <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes were originally present in the ancestor of the putatively monophyletic [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] Chlorophyta clade. Similar genes are still present in several of the present day descendants of these ancestral Chlorophyta, most notably in some, but not all, Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae.

To date, full genomic sequence data are only available for one species of the Charophyta, namely the terrestrial and freshwater filamentous alga, <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic>, where as many as five <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes are also present. In addition, transcriptome data from the related species, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>crenulatum</italic> show the desiccation-induced expression of no fewer than six CLO/PXG-like genes [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. <italic>Klebsormidium</italic> algae have primitive body plans and are made up of multicellular non-branching filaments that can survive on the land with substantial tolerance to novel stresses, such as drought and freezing, which do not normally occur in aquatic environments [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Therefore it is possible that as some Streptophyte algae became increasingly adapted to terrestrial conditions, new functions emerged for the CLO/PXG proteins inherited from their marine ancestors. Given the ubiquity of the occurrence of <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like genes in the Embryophytes (see below), it seems likely that similar genes will be found in other Charophyte species once more sequence data become available in the future.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>The CLO/PXG gene family in the Embryophytes</title><p>Embryophytes are a monophyletic group probably diverged from Charophytes about 500 Mya and there is robust fossil evidence of their presence in a variety of terrestrial environments by 430&#x02013;490 Mya [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The most basal groups of Embryophytes are the Liverworts and Bryophytes (mosses) each of which is represented by just one sequenced genome, namely <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> and <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>. In both cases their genomes contain only L isoform <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like sequences, suggesting that the H isoform has been lost in these relatively primitive non-vascular, multicellular plants. However, both L and H <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> isoforms are present in lycophyte, <italic>Selaginella moellendorfii</italic>, which is a fern-like seedless vascular plant that can form true roots and has the kind of ABA signalling pathways for which the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> CLO/PXG isoform, ATCLO4, acts as a negative regulator [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Although no true fern genomes have been sequenced, such data are available for four species of Gymnosperm, which are seed-bearing vascular, but non-flowering, higher plants. In all cases, only H isoform <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> are present in these genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196669.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Therefore, in the case of this admittedly small sample of non-flowering land plants, most species contain only one of these two <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> isoforms.</p><p>To date <italic>CLO/PXG-</italic>like genes have been found in all of the &#x0003e;300 angiosperm species for which sequence data are available. The split between Angiosperms and other vascular plants occurred &#x0003e;200 Mya [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and the former now make up the majority of the terrestrial flora in terms of biomass and species diversity[<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In all of these species our analysis suggests that there is at least one copy each of the L and H isoforms of CLO/PXG and that in many cases these genes have become highly duplicated to form relatively large families of <italic>CLO/PXG-</italic>like genes, many of which are differentially expressed in various developmental and/or environmental conditions. We and others have previously shown that in a range of higher plants including Arabidopsis, maize, and rice, some <italic>CLO</italic> genes are induced by a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g. <italic>RD20</italic>, <italic>AtPXG1</italic>, <italic>AtPXG2</italic>, <italic>EFA27</italic>, <italic>OsCLO-2</italic>, <italic>OsCLO-6</italic>, <italic>ZmCLO7</italic>) while other <italic>CLO</italic> genes are unresponsive to such stresses but may be highly expressed in lipid-storing tissues such as seeds [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It is also possible to divide higher plant CLO/PXGs into two functional groups, one of which has very low epoxygenase activity when expressed under standard conditions and tends to be seed specific, while the other has high epoxygenase activity and is expressed throughout the plant[<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In many well-characterised higher plant genomes there are large numbers of <italic>CLO/PXG-</italic>like genes, such as six in Arabidopsis, 11 in the diploid Brassicas, nine in rice and 12 in maize. These sequences include highly conserved regions also found in algae, plus more variable regions some of which may have arisen after the monocot/dicot divergence of about 150&#x02013;160 Mya [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In some cases the annotated <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> sequences appear to be pseudogenes as they are not expressed and in some cases lack crucial CLO domains and may also contain additional non-CLO domains. An example of the latter is the presence of bZIP and PKinase domains in the non-expressed putative maize sequences, <italic>ZmCLO1</italic> and <italic>ZmCLO2a</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]and in an Arabidopsis <italic>CLO</italic> sequence [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p><p>The expansion and increasing complexity of <italic>CLO/PXG-</italic>like gene families in land plants is consistent with the evolution of a wider range of functions by the various CLO/PXG protein isoforms. Some of the functions relating to nutrient stress responses and LD packaging are also seen even in unicellular green algae and are probably universal for CLO/PXGs [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].

It is also becoming evident that CLO/PXGs have central roles in plant-pathogen responses, especially with fungi where the proteins may be involved in both host and pathogen crosstalk via oxylipin pathways [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In summary, the evolution of the <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> gene family in the Viridiplantae involves over one billion years of gradually expanding functions as these organisms increased in size and complexity and had to adapt to new forms of biotic and abiotic stress as they colonised new habitats and faced new challenges both in the sea and on land.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Putative <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes/proteins in a bacterium and a basal opisthokont</title><p>We found that public databases contain several DNA sequences with weak to moderate similarity to <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> in other major taxa apart from Viridiplantae or Fungi.

This may indicate that the genes were originally acquired as isolated instances of HGT and then became duplicated and were retained as multiple-copy gene families due to their usefulness for the particular lifestyles of these organisms. For example, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cellulosum</italic></p><p>Soce56 is a highly unusual aerobic myxobacterium that has the largest bacterial genome sequenced to date at 14.8 Mb [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The genome of this bacterium has undergone massive expansion due to gene endo-duplication and HGT, and its lifestyle involves high levels of social behaviour and production of a wide range of secondary metabolites with complex regulatory networks including many kinases that facilitate responses to rapidly fluctuating environments [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. With their known roles in stress responses, signal transduction, and oxylipin metabolism it can be seen why the presence of as many as seven <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes might be adaptive for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cellulosum</italic>.</p><p>In the case of the nematode genus, <italic>Panagrolaimus spp</italic>, a BLAST search with the five putative <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> sequences gave both higher plants and fungal <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>s in the top few hits. Therefore, if the original gene was acquired via HGT, as seems likely it is not clear whether the donor was a plant or a fungus. One interesting feature of the putative <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes from the nematodes is that they were only found in parthenogenetic species in the genus and are functionally linked to cryptobiosis and especially to desiccation tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. As discussed above, the algal caleosins are highly upregulated following salt stress and may also have played a role in the transition of more complex plants from aquatic to terrestrial environments with the concomitant requirement for improved tolerance to desiccation.</p><p>A third well-supported putative <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> gene family is present in another unusual organism, namely the eukaryote, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>owczarzaki</italic>, which is a filose amoeboid symbiont of the pulmonate snail, <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>. Genomic sequence data suggest that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>owczarzaki</italic> is a member of an opisthokont lineage, the Holozoa, which is more closely related to the Metazoa than to the other major multicellular opisthokont group, the Fungi [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Interestingly, during specific phases of its life cycle, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>owczarzaki</italic> cells accumulate and then extrude LDs, although it is not known whether these extracellular LDs contain CLO/PXGs as is found in several algae (see above) [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196669.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>].</p><p>A less likely candidate CLO/PXG protein has been reported in the dinoflagellate, <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0196669.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] In this case an LD-associated 20kDa protein in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells cross-reacted with anti-CLO/PXG antibodies generated against purified sesame and cycad proteins, which could possibly imply the presence of a CLO/PXG protein in this species. However, <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>, which is a photosynthetic endosymbiont within the reef building coral, <italic>Euphyllia glabrescens</italic> is a dinoflagellate that is unrelated to either the Viridiplantae or Fungi, having acquired its plastids from red algae, which do not have <italic>CLO/PXG</italic> genes (see above). Therefore, in the absence of definitive sequence data for the 20kDa LD protein or its gene, it cannot be assumed to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> CLO/PXG.</p><p>Finally, we found a few isolated database entries of <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like sequences in genomes of taxa from which these genes are thought to be absent, most notably the Metazoa. For example, we found a <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like sequence with very strong identity to higher plants in the genome entry for the Gulf Coast tick, <italic>Amblyomma maculatum</italic> (GenBank: AEO32378.1). These ticks are parasites of small mammals and birds. The entry was from a shotgun transcriptome assembly that had involved the collection of several hundred million sequences from ticks kept in culture. Correspondence with the lab concerned established that the ticks used in the study also harboured some algal growths on their external surfaces and that this may have been the source of the <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like sequence. It can be concluded that this particular <italic>CLO/PXG</italic>-like database entry is highly likely to be erroneous and due to contamination from plant or algal sequences rather than to HGT. The take-home messages from the two examples of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic>, are that a) considerable caution should be exercised in the use of antibody cross reactivity in the absence of sequence data and b) anomalous sequence entries in databases should be carefully scrutinised before definite conclusions are drawn.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The distribution of CLO/PXG-like genes is consistent with their origin &#x0003e;1 billion years ago in at least two of the earliest diverging groups of the Viridiplantae, namely Chlorophyta and Streptophyta but the Viridiplantae from other Archaeplastidal groups such as the Rhodophyta and Glaucophyta. The algal CLO/PXGs have roles in lipid packaging and stress responses, especially related to dehydration and salinity. In contrast, the Embryophyte CLO/PXG proteins have a much wider spectrum of physiological roles including oxylipin signaling pathways, and may have been instrumental in the colonisation of terrestrial habitats and the subsequent diversification as the major land flora.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196669.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Workflow of the bioinformatics analysis.</title><p>The workflow details the procedures performed during data analysis.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0196669.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196669.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Transmembrane domain prediction.</title><p>Data from 34 species are displayed showing predicted TM domains.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0196669.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196669.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Secondary structure prediction.</title><p>Data from 34 species are displayed showing predicted secondary structures.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0196669.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196669.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Intron/exon analysis.</title><p>Summary chart of overall intron/exon numbers in each of the 67 analysed genes.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0196669.s004.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196669.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Predicted intron-exon sequence blocks across selected <italic>CLO/PXGs</italic> from 34 species.</title><p>Due to unavailability of full genome sequence data for some genes in public databases, intron-exons were analysed for 60 out of 67 sequences from 34 species.
