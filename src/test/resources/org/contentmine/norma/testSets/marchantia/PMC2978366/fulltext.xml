However, some RNA editing events are found in non-coding regions at critical positions in the predicted secondary and tertiary structures of introns, suggesting that RNA editing could be important for splicing. Here, we studied the relationships between editing and splicing of the mRNA encoding the ribosomal protein S10 (<italic>rps10</italic>), which has a group II intron and five editing sites. Two of them, C2 and C3, predicted to stabilize the folded structure of the intron necessary for splicing, were studied by using <italic>rps10</italic> mutants introduced into isolated potato mitochondria by electroporation. While mutations of C2 involved in EBS2/IBS2 interactions did not affect splicing, probably by the presence of an alternative EBS2&#x02032; region in domain I of the intron, the edition of site C3 turned out to be critical for <italic>rps10</italic> mRNA splicing; only the edited (U) form of the transcript was processed. Interestingly, RNA editing was strongly reduced in transcripts from two different intronless genes, <italic>rps10</italic> from potato and <italic>cox2</italic> from wheat, suggesting that efficient RNA processing may require a close interaction of factors engaged in different maturation processes. This is the first report linking editing and splicing in conditions close to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In plant mitochondria, transcripts undergo several post-transcriptional modifications, such as RNA editing, <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and trimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). RNA editing of organellar transcripts is found in all land plants with the exception of the basal liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). RNA editing occurs by base deamination of specific cytosines on the transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, 456 editing events have been described in the different mitochondrial transcripts; most of the C-to-U conversions concern the coding region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and change the genomic encoded amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Moreover, the number of editing sites can vary between different tissues or ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Changes in the coding region in plant mitochondrial transcripts increase the similarity of the encoded proteins with their counterparts from organisms which do not edit their transcripts. Thus, RNA editing constitutes an essential step to ensure the production of functional proteins and the proper functioning of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, a few editing events occur in non-coding regions, particularly in introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), but their role in mitochondria is not well understood. Recently, the study of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> mitochondrial transcriptome indicates that the extent of RNA editing in mitochondrial introns could be higher than anticipated in land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial intervening sequences from higher plants belong to the group II introns family, with the exception of a group I intron found in some species, issued from horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Group II introns, either in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), have a well-characterized secondary structure with particular regions which are essential to ensure a good secondary and tertiary conformation, as for example the intron binding site (IBS)/exon binding site (EBS) interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It is interesting to note that some editing sites are found in highly structured domains of introns or in the IBS domain of exon, very close to the intron. Consequently, it has been suggested that in some cases editing can be necessary for splicing, by allowing a canonical folding of the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). It has also been proposed that RNA splicing could create the <italic>cis-</italic>elements necessary for the editing of some sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To date, evidence for a possible link between splicing and editing is scarce, most arguments being issued from predictions of base pair interactions concerning the putative secondary structure of the intron. In wheat mitochondria, <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad5</italic> present C-to-U transitions found in the domain 6 (D6) stem of the respective <italic>trans</italic>-introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In both cases, RNA editing is postulated to facilitate the change of the secondary structure of D6 to a conformation apt to carry out the first transesterification step during splicing. While RNA editing in coding regions can reasonably be assumed as important for protein function, the inference on the consequence of RNA editing in non-coding regions is less evident necessitating additional experimental support. B&#x000f6;rner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) suggested that editing was required for splicing using an <italic>in vitro</italic> system in which the stem of domain 6, either with the genomic C or the edited U, of intron <italic>nad1-c/d</italic> was grafted into an autocatalytic yeast intron and found that only the edited chimera was released as a lariat, while the precursor with the genomic encoded C remained inactive.</p><p>In this report, we addressed the question on the relationship between RNA editing and splicing using the ribosomal protein S10 gene (<italic>rps10</italic>) as a model. Previously we found that <italic>rps10</italic> constructs were correctly expressed, edited and spliced in electroporated potato mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). <italic>rps10</italic> contains one intron and five C residues are involved in RNA editing; one of them is located in the intron. Based on the canonical structure of group II introns, two editing sites, one located at the IBS2 and another situated at the beginning of the intron, were proposed to be involved in the correct folding of the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Here, we tested this hypothesis by introducing the engineered <italic>Solanum tuberosum rps10</italic> gene and mutant derivatives into isolated cognate mitochondria by electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, we examined the impact of the presence of the intron on the ability of the mRNA to be edited. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental exploration of the interaction between RNA editing and RNA splicing in plant mitochondria close to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>All plasmids used in this study are based on the pRPS10St vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The intronless construct, pRPS10Sti-, was constructed by creating two ApaI restriction sites, at the end of exon 1 and the beginning of exon 2 by site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotides I1 and I2. The mutant was then digested with ApaI endonuclease (Promega) and the fragment corresponding to the plasmid without the intronic sequence was recovered after separation on agarose gel electrophoresis and then circularized with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). The remaining ApaI site was eliminated by directed mutagenesis, using primer I3 to restore the wild-type sequence at this position. All mutants used here were obtained with the QuickChange&#x000ae; Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) under the conditions indicated by the furnisher. Purification of restriction fragments and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) products was carried out with the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare).

A second potential EBS2 region, called EBS2&#x02032;, can be detected 65&#x02009;nt upstream of EBS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The IBS2&#x02013;EBS2&#x02032; interaction should be unaffected by RNA editing since the C2 residue is not directly involved in the putative IBS2&#x02013;EBS2&#x02032; base pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).

C-to-U change by RNA editing of C3 residue corrects the A:C mispair to a canonical A:U base pair and consequently generates a more stable stem at the beginning of D1.

Transcripts from this mutant were unable to undergo splicing in electroporated potato mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). To validate this observation, the A residue, supposed to interact with the edited C3 residue in the D1 stem, was changed into a T (A3T).

Most RNA editing events concern the production of functional proteins since they affect coding regions. In fact, they occur mainly at significant positions, i.e. the first and second residue of the codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, several reports describe C-to-U editing occurring in intronic regions and potentially affecting splicing. These events concern strategic positions in the putative secondary structures or tertiary interactions of introns.</p><p>Based on these observations, it has been proposed that RNA editing might be required for RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29">26&#x02013;29</xref>). For example, C-to-U editing in the domain 6 (D6) of <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad5 trans</italic>-introns from wheat mitochondria is needed to obtain the canonical D6 stem&#x02013;loop structure required for the first transesterification step during splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Similarly in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, different editing events were predicted to improve the secondary structure of the <italic>nad5</italic>&#x02009;a/b and <italic>nad 7</italic>&#x02009;b/c introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In <italic>Oenothera</italic>, editing occurs in the basal stem of the domain 1 (D1) of the second intron of the <italic>nad2</italic> gene, at an analogous position to the <italic>rps10</italic> gene described in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, the study of the editing status of these particular editing sites in precursor molecules is not informative enough to conclude on a direct role of editing in the splicing process. Previously, one indirect evidence of the implication of RNA editing in the splicing process has been reported by B&#x000f6;rner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In this work, the edited or the unedited version of <italic>nad1</italic>&#x02009;c/d intron D6 from <italic>Oenothera</italic> mitochondria was grafted into a yeast self-splicing intron. Only the chimera containing the edited form of D6 was able to undergo self-splicing.</p><p>Although both editing and splicing events are essential for the production of functional proteins, no clear understanding of how transcript maturation proceeds is available. In this work, we studied the eventual link between RNA editing and splicing using an <italic>in organello</italic> model to introduce engineered DNA constructs into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Using this approach, we have determined the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regions required for RNA editing in plant mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and the functional elements necessary for splicing of the <italic>cox2</italic> intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Previously, we observed that when constructs containing the <italic>S. tuberosum rps10</italic> gene, under the control of <italic>cox2</italic> promoter, were electroporated into potato tuber mitochondria, the transgene was correctly transcribed, spliced and edited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Sequence analysis of spliced mRNAs showed the presence of partially edited molecules, indicating that full RNA editing is not a prerequisite for splicing. Of particular interest is the site C2 which was found edited in only 50% of mature transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). This result is in agreement with observations made with <italic>cox2</italic> constructs in wheat mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Among the five cytosine residues edited in <italic>rps10</italic> mRNA, two of them, C2 and C3 have been proposed to participate in secondary and tertiary interactions characteristic of group II introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). C2 participates in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the intron, linking the IBS2 region of exon 1 with EBS2 sequence through Watson&#x02013;Crick interactions. C3 is found mispaired with an A residue in the stem connecting D1 with the central wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The unedited C2 can interact with the G residue of the 3&#x02032; end of EBS2. When edited, C2 can form a G:U wobble base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), a type of interaction often observed in RNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Mutant transcripts in which the C2 residue was replaced by U gave a similar result compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In addition, when a completely edited transgene was used to electroporate mitochondria, no difference in splicing efficiency was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). These results indicate that editing in the <italic>rps10</italic> coding region is not involved in splicing, and explain why partially edited transcripts can be found amid spliced molecules.</p><sec><title>An alternative IBS2&#x02013;EBS2&#x02032; interaction act in concert with the canonical IBS2&#x02013;EBS2</title><p>In previous work, we found that EBS2 region was not acting alone in the splicing reaction, but that a second upstream region, designated as EBS2&#x02032;, participates in the intron removal in wheat mitochondrial <italic>cox2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that a potential EBS2&#x02032; sequence also exists in the D1 domain of the <italic>rps10</italic> intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). It should be noted that the C2 editing site is excluded from the putative IBS2:EBS2&#x02032; interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). To verify the function of EBS regions, three internal residues were changed in EBS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). A mutant which cannot sustain base pairing with IBS2 did not abolish, but reduced significantly the splicing efficiency, compared to the wild-type transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Oppositely, when the EBS2&#x02032; region was mutated, no changes in splicing efficiency were observed. Only when both EBS2 and EBS2&#x02032; mutations were introduced in the same <italic>rps10</italic> construct, splicing was completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These results suggest that while EBS2 and EBS2&#x02032; do not play a crucial role individually, they probably act concertedly to facilitate the splicing reaction. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that EBS2&#x02032; plays other role in the complex interactions responsible for the three-dimensional folding of group II introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This observation, which confirms previous results with <italic>cox2</italic> in a different plant model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), clearly suggests a general role for the EBS2&#x02032; motif in intron excision of group II introns from plant mitochondria.</p><p>Since modifications in the vicinity of the target C residue may affect the editing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), the same experiments were performed with constructs having C2 replaced by a T residue. Identical results were obtained with the edited (T2) version of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These results confirm that editing of C2 is not connected with the splicing reaction, and is consistent with the fact that unedited intermediates can be found in spliced mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). It was proposed that exon fusion after splicing generated the <italic>cis</italic>-recognition elements for editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This is not the case for <italic>rps10</italic> since C2 can be found edited in precursor mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The ability of RNA to sustain a stable G-U wobble base pair and the presence of a second EBS2&#x02032; region, which exclude the C2 residue in the IBS2-EBS2&#x02032; interaction, may explain why editing of the C2 residue is not a&#x02009;prerequisite for&#x02009;splicing. Most probably, the C-to-U transition of site C2 is connected with translation since C2 editing induces an important change in the encoded amino acid. In fact, the genomic encoded R (CGG) residue is changed into W (UGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although we confirmed the role of an optional EBS2&#x02032; region, the effect of mutations in EBS sequences from <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> mitochondrial <italic>rps10</italic> was less drastic than those observed for <italic>T. aestivum cox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Further work will be required to understand the actual role of these domains during the splicing process.</p></sec><sec><title>Editing of C3 is a prerequisite for splicing of <italic>rps10</italic> mRNA</title><p>The basal stem of intron domain I is crucial for the excision of the first intron of <italic>cob</italic> mRNA from yeast mitochondria; a single mutation impairing this region abolished the splicing reaction <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Interestingly, the C3 residue in the <italic>rps10</italic> intron is found in an equivalent position to those described for the yeast intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In the canonical secondary structure of the <italic>rps10</italic> intron, C3 is opposed to an A residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Editing of the C3 residue should restore the A:U base pairing allowing the formation of a more stable stem and facilitate the splicing reaction. This hypothesis was verified by changing C3 by an A, or by changing the opposite A residue by a T. Both mutants, unable to ensure base pairing, showed a complete inhibition of splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, by combining both mutations, which restores the base pair ability at this position, a complete recovery of the splicing process was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). From these results, we conclude that the structure of the basal stem of the domain I is essential for intron splicing and that RNA editing of C3 residue is crucial to ensure the correct secondary structure required for mRNA splicing. This mechanism may also operate for other genes in different plant models since a similar editing site has been described in a <italic>trans</italic>-splicing intervening sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that RNA editing of a C residue is mandatory for the splicing of a mitochondrial mRNA precursor in conditions closer to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Post-transcriptional processing events may be coupled in plant mitochondria</title><p>Taken together, these observations indicate that RNA editing constitutes a general correction mechanism devoted to the proper functioning of different steps of gene expression in plant mitochondria. If this is true, effects on RNA editing would be expected when other RNA processing events are modified. In previous work, we found that a potato <italic>rps10</italic> mRNA expressed in wheat mitochondria remained unspliced and concomitantly, an editing site from wheat grafted in the chimeric transgene was not recognized by the cognate organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We speculated that this behavior could reflect a complex system conveying the primary transcript to processing, i.e. that RNA editing occurs mainly when transcripts are engaged in post-transcriptional processing. To get further insight about this issue, we analyzed the fate of editing sites in an intronless <italic>rps10</italic> construct, which obviously does not require the splicing step. Surprisingly, a significant reduction in editing efficiency was observed for all four editing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), suggesting that in some way the different maturation processes are potentiating each other.</p><p>The inhibition of RNA editing in transcripts devoid of intron seems to be a more general phenomenon, since a similar situation was observed when an intronless <italic>cox2</italic> construct was expressed in wheat mitochondria. The <italic>cox2</italic> mRNA undergoes 15&#x02009;C-to-U editing changes in the translated region when the transgene is expressed in isolated mitochondria. The editing efficiency for individual sites is in the range between 40% and 100%. However, the intronless <italic>cox2</italic> mRNA was severely affected in editing efficiency for all the editing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>The fact that <italic>cis</italic>-recognition elements for RNA editing reside in the vicinity of the target C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and the observation that heterologous editing sites can be recognized when grafted in chimeric genes outside their natural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), suggest that this situation was probably not connected with structural modifications generated by the lack of the intron. It should also be noted that some sites are found edited in precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and, conversely, partially edited and unedited mature transcripts can be found in spliced mRNAs. We interpret these results as a cooperation of both, splicing and editing mechanisms. Obviously, this situation does not apply to transcripts from genes naturally devoid of introns; in that case, RNA editing proceeds efficiently. However, other maturation processes such as RNA trimming seem also to affect RNA editing of mRNAs and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The possibility to introduce <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) may help to answer some of the questions raised in this study, under conditions&#x02009;independent of the gene expression pathway.</p><p>Interestingly, the lack of maturation (trimming) of <italic>atp6</italic> mRNAs, in a <italic>Rf-1</italic> rice mutant with a cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) phenotype, correlates with the presence of unedited and partially edited RNAs, indicating that the presence of the <italic>Rf-1</italic> gene influences the RNA maturation and editing of the <italic>B-atp6</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Nuclear suppressors of the sterile phenotype, <italic>Rf-1a</italic> and <italic>Rf-1b</italic>, have been identified as members of the Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein (PPR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). This type of proteins has been implicated in several steps of gene expression in plant organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The PPR protein OTP43 is important for <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of the first <italic>nad1</italic> intron in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Moreover, some proteins belonging to a particular PPR subfamily have been identified as potential <italic>trans-</italic>acting factors for mitochondrial RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44 B45 B46 B47 B48 B49 B50">44&#x02013;50</xref>). According to the picture emerging from the present study, one can imagine that some protein factors, for example PPR proteins, act as chaperones ensuring the engagement of transcripts into the maturation process. Thus, the intron removal of <italic>rps10</italic>, a naturally interrupted gene, may result in impaired recognition of the transcript by processing proteins, leading to a global maturation defect, and therefore alter the editing process.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Universit&#x000e9; Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, France; the PICS program n&#x000b0; 3641.
