Specifically in plants, drought tolerance is a desirable phenotype. However, limited focused and organized functional genomic datasets exist on drought-responsive plant USP genes to facilitate their characterization. The overall objective of the investigation was to identify diverse plant universal stress proteins and Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) responsive to water-deficit stress. We hypothesize that cross-database mining of functional annotations in protein and gene transcript bioinformatics resources would help identify candidate drought-responsive universal stress proteins and transcripts from multiple plant species. Our bioinformatics approach retrieved, mined and integrated comprehensive functional annotation data on 511 protein and 1561 ESTs sequences from 161 viridiplantae taxa. A total of 32 drought-responsive ESTs from 7 plant genera <italic>Glycine</italic>, <italic>Hordeum</italic>, <italic>Manihot</italic>, <italic>Medicago</italic>, <italic>Oryza</italic>, <italic>Pinus</italic> and <italic>Triticum</italic> were identified. Two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> USP genes At3g62550 and At3g53990 that encode ATP-binding motif were up-regulated in a drought microarray dataset. Further, a dataset of 80 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) linked to 20 singletons and 47 transcript assembles was constructed. Integrating the datasets on SSRs and drought-responsive ESTs identified three drought-responsive ESTs from bread wheat (BE604157), soybean (BM887317) and maritime pine (BX682209). The SSR sequence types were CAG, ATA and AT respectively. The datasets from cross-database mining provide organized resources for the characterization of USP genes as useful targets for engineering plant varieties tolerant to unfavorable environmental conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>drought</kwd><kwd>expressed sequence tags</kwd><kwd>microsatellite</kwd><kwd>plants</kwd><kwd>Pfam</kwd><kwd>salinity</kwd><kwd>simple sequence repeats</kwd><kwd>Uniprot</kwd><kwd>universal stress protein domain</kwd><kwd>viridiplantae</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Environmental stresses can negatively impact agricultural crop yield and quality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-bbi-2011-041">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-bbi-2011-041">2</xref> As an adaptive strategy, plant genomes encode genes that produce proteins that function in stress response and tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-bbi-2011-041">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-bbi-2011-041">5</xref> Despite substantial research on response to abiotic and biotic stresses by plants, there are still knowledge gaps regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the diverse functions of environmental stress-associated plant genes and proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-bbi-2011-041">3</xref> The increasing availability of genomic sequences of members of the viridiplantae (green algae and land plants) in combination with high-throughput bioinformatics tools and databases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-bbi-2011-041">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-bbi-2011-041">5</xref> provide new opportunities for examining understudied gene families that could be central to stress response in plants.</p><p>Genes encoding proteins that contain the conserved 140&#x02013;160 residues Universal Stress Protein (USP) domain (Pfam Accession: PF00582) are known to provide bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and plants with the ability to respond to a plethora of environmental stresses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-bbi-2011-041">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-bbi-2011-041">9</xref> Nutrient starvation, drought, high salinity, extreme temperatures and exposure to toxic chemicals are examples of conditions that induce expression of genes with the USP domain.

In addition, there are specialized plant databases not yet linked to UniProt. For example, the Phytozome resource page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/Phytozome_resources.php">http://www.phytozome.net/Phytozome_resources.php</ext-link>) provides links to resources for general plant genomics; gene expression; gene indices and Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs); <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; grass and cereals; legumes; forest trees; other plant species and plant pathogen genomics. The overall objective of the investigation was to identify diverse plant universal stress proteins and Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) responsive to water-deficit stress. We hypothesize that cross-database mining of functional annotations in protein and gene transcript bioinformatics resources would help identify candidate drought-responsive universal stress proteins and transcripts from multiple plant species.</p><p>Among the ESTs and cDNA resources listed in Phytozome, we observed that the TIGR Plant Transcript Assemblies database (Plantta)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-bbi-2011-041">27</xref> had a wide collection of 254 plant species (as of July 2007). The ESTs and full-length cDNA are being used for discovery of genes in plant species as well as evidence of gene expression in conditions as well as anatomic parts.

Subsequently, for non-obsolete or deleted UniProt entries, the protein domain architecture, organism source of sequence, protein sequence length and protein molecular weight were extracted from XML-formatted UniProt entries (UniProt release 2010_10&#x02014;Oct 5, 2010). These selected annotations are typically available for UniProt entries. Overview of the USP dataset construction is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-bbi-2011-041">Figure 1</xref>.

The cross-referenced databases for each viridiplantae USP entry was computationally extracted from the XML formatted files. A non-redundant list of the databases was assembled and used to construct a presence-absence matrix consisting of rows of UniProt protein identifiers and columns of selected databases. A zero (0) was used to encode absence of cross-referencing to a database and one (1) for presence of cross-reference to a database.

Furthermore, the OMA Browser allows for exploration of orthologous relations between protein sequences for 1000 species (Release of May 2010). A combination of the data from GXA and OMA allowed us to identify orthologous plant proteins in which a member has been demonstrated to be responsive to drought.
