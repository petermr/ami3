<p>Class II transactivator exerts its transactivating function through protein–protein interactions with the components of the MHC-enhanceosome bound to the proximal SXY regulatory module in MHC promoters (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Masternak et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2000</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2000</xref>; Jabrane-Ferrat et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2003</xref>). This interaction of CIITA with the MHC-enhanceosome allows for the subsequent recruitment of the lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) p300 (KAT3b)/CREB binding protein (CBP or KAT3a) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF or KAT2b), which promote transcription of 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> and 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes by providing a more open chromatin structure (Kretsovali et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1998</xref>; Fontes et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1999</xref>; Spilianakis et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2000</xref>; Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>). Furthermore, CIITA also recruits the co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase-1/protein arginine 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase 4 (CARM1/PRMT4; Zika and Ting, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">2005</xref>; Zika et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2005</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Besides acting as a platform for recruitment of KAT activities, CIITA itself contains intrinsic KAT activity. The CIITA-mediated transactivation of MHC promoters was found to rely on this intrinsic KAT activity, which maps to a region in its N-terminus (Raval et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2001</xref>). This KAT activity of CIITA is regulated by its C-terminal GTP-binding domain and is stimulated by GTP (Raval et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2001</xref>). Interestingly, the CIITA KAT activity was found to bypass TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor 250 kDa (TAF
 <sub>II</sub>250) in MHC-I promoter activation (Raval et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2001</xref>). Moreover, acetylation of CIITA itself by CBP and/or PCAF at specific lysine residues within the bipartite nuclear localization signal in the amino-terminal region of CIITA governs its nuclear accumulation (Spilianakis et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2000</xref>).
