 <italic>In vivo</italic> footprint analysis of CIITA-PI in immature dendritic cells revealed multiple protein/DNA interactions that were lost upon maturation of dendritic cells. CIITA-PI was found to contain binding sites for PU.1, Sp-1 NF-κB, and a composite Ets/ISRE (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>). Transcription mediated by CIITA-PI in immature dendritic cells requires binding of PU.1, IRF-8, NF-κB, and Sp-1 to the promoter (Smith et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>). Interestingly, for binding of PU.1 to the composite Ets/ISRE heterodimerization with IRF-8 is a prerequisite. Mutational analysis of the PU.1, IRF-8, and NF-κB sites showed that these sites were critical for transcriptional activity of CIITA-PI. Of note is also that mice lacking IRF-8 displayed an unoccupied CIITA-PI, which was restored by reconstitution with IRF-8

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>). Together, these observations reveal an important role for PU.1/IRF-8 in the activation of CIITA-PI in immature dendritic cells.
