<p>Constitutive and induced transcription of 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> and 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes is mediated by a set of conserved regulatory elements in their promoters and interacting transcription factors of which the SXY-module is shared by both sets of genes. CIITA plays an essential role in the control of constitutive and induced 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> gene transcription through its interaction with the MHC-enhanceosome bound to the conserved SXY-module in MHC-II promoters. When bound to the MHC-enhanceosome, CIITA acts as a platform recruiting various activities involved in histone acetylation/deacetylation and methylation. CIITA is also central to recruitment of more general chromatin remodeling activities and long-range chromatin interactions of MHC-II promoters with distal elements. These activities mediated by CIITA provide strict control of transcription of these important immune genes. An additional level of transcriptional control for 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> gene expression is at the level of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic>, the gene encoding CIITA, which is also tightly regulated by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Because of the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the transcriptional control of 
 <italic>MHC</italic> genes, deviations in these epigenetic mechanisms as observed under pathological conditions such as in cancer and autoimmune disease might provide an opportunity for pharmacological interference targeting the enzymes that modify DNA and histones.
