<p>Class II transactivator-PIII is employed in B cells and activated T cells in humans (Ghosh et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1999</xref>; Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2002</xref>; Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2002a</xref>; Wong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2002</xref>). Activation of CIITA-PIII requires interaction of the transcription factor CREB-1 with CRE-binding sites in the activation response element (ARE)-2 and, depending on the cellular context, also with CRE-binding sites in the 5′-UTR of CIITA-PIII (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2002</xref>; Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2002a</xref>; Wong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2002</xref>). The CREB-1 mediated activation of CIITA-PIII in B cells was amplified by the KAT CBP (Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2002a</xref>). CIITA-PIII also contains a composite Ets/ISRE-consensus element (Site C) and 2 E-box motifs, which were found to play a crucial role in its B cell-specific transcriptional regulation (Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">2004</xref>). In B cells the Ets/ISRE-consensus element is bound by PU.1 and IRF-4, whereas the basic helix-loop-helix factor E47 interacts with the E-box motifs. When bound respectively to the Ets/ISRE and E-boxes PU.1 and IRF-4, and E47 synergize to direct B cell-specific activation of CIITA-PIII (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">2004</xref>). The involvement of these factors in B cell-specific activation of CIITA-PIII is of interest because PU.1, IRF-4, and E47 also play an important role in B cell differentiation and activation.
