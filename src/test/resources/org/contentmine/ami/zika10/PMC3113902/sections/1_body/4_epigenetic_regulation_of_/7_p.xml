<p>Distal elements and chromatin remodeling also play an essential role in the transcriptional regulation of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> (Ni et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2008</xref>). Transcriptional activation of CIITA-PIV by IFNγ relies on the interaction with distal elements at −50 and −8 kb (Ni et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2008</xref>). Contact was also detected between elements at −50 and −16 kb. In these long-range interactions, BRG-1, the ATPase driving the chromatin remodeling complex SWI-SNF (also called BAF), was constitutively bound to sites at −50, −16, −8, and +59 kb, and also CIITA-IV (Ni et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2008</xref>). Thus BRG-1 not only is an important factor in the CIITA-mediated activation of 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes, but also controls the transcriptional activation of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> itself through long-range chromatin and promoter interactions.
