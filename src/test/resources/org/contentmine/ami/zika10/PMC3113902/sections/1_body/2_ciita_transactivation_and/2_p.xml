<p>Class II transactivator also interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs), which were found to interfere with CIITA function. These activities that acetylate/deacetylate lysine residues act as molecular switches for CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation/silencing of 
 <italic>MHC</italic> genes. In this respect, it was found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 interfere in the transcriptional transactivation function of CIITA following IFNγ induction (Zika et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2003</xref>; Kong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2009</xref>). In mice the HDAC1/HDAC2-associated repressor SIN3 homolog A (mSin3A) amplifies this inhibition in CIITA function (Zika et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2003</xref>). HDAC2 has the potential to deacetylate CIITA through its interaction with CIITA (Kong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2009</xref>). This results in targeting of CIITA to the proteasomal degradation machinery and decreased interaction of CIITA with the RFX component RFX5 (Kong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2009</xref>). Together, these observations reveal that these HDAC activities affect CIITA function on the one hand by disrupting assembly of the MHC-enhanceosome, while on the other hand they interfere in CIITA interactions with the MHC-enhanceosome. The switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) ATPase Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG-1) also associates with CIITA and is required for the CIITA-mediated induction of 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes (Mudhasani and Fontes, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2002</xref>). The association of CIITA and BRG-1 suggest that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex is recruited by CIITA to MHC-II promoters to control transcription of 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes. The ATPase Sug 1, a component of the 19S proteasome (19S P) complex, was found to be involved in increased levels of acetylation at MHC-II promoters and appeared to be essential for CIITA stability and 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> expression (Bhat et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2010a</xref>; Koues et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2008</xref>). More recently, another subunit of the 19S proteosome complex, the ATPase S6a (S6′/Tat-binding protein 1), was found to be crucial for regulating cytokine-inducible transcription of CIITA thereby indirectly modulation 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> transcription (Truax et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">2010</xref>). Other activities involved monoubiquitination of CIITA, which was shown to stabilize CIITA at MHC-II promoters (Bhat et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010b</xref>). In addition MLL/COMPASS subunits, which are involved in establishing active histone H3-K4 methylation marks, were found also to be recruited to MHC-II promoters following IFNγ treatment of cells (Koues et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2010</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).
