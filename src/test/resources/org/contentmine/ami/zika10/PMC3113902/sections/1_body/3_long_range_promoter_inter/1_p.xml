<p>The appropriate temporal and spatial expression of 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> also requires the involvement of additional, long-range regulatory elements. The more distal X–Y or X-box like sequences in the 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> region play an important role in these processes (Gomez et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>). It has been found that interactions between the proximal elements and more distal X–Y or X-box like sequences (2.3 kb upstream of the HLA-DRA promoter) result in epigenetic changes at the MHC-II promoter (Masternak et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2003</xref>; Wright and Ting, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">2006</xref>; Choi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2011</xref>). In one model, RFX and CIITA can interact with the proximal SXY-module and with distal X–Y or X-box like sequences to form a chromatin loop (Masternak et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2003</xref>). This chromatin loop results in enhanced histone acetylation (Krawczyk et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2004</xref>). Likewise, the transcriptional insulator factor CCCTC binding factor insulator (CTCF) was found to control 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> gene expression through long-distance chromatin interactions (Majumder et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2008</xref>). The intergenic DNA of the 
 <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic> genes hosts a region that was bound by CTCF and acts as a potent enhancer-blocking element (Majumder et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2006</xref>). This element and its bound factors were found to interact with 
 <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic> (Majumder et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2008</xref>). Subsequently it was demonstrated that CTCF associates with CIITA and RFX5 suggesting that the CTCF bound region and the flanking HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 proximal promoters may interact (Majumder et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2008</xref>). More recently it was shown by RNAi depletion of CTCF that all CIITA-regulated genes within the 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> locus required CTCF for maximal expression (Majumder and Boss, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>).
