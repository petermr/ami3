<p>The products of the 
 <italic>MHC class I (MHC-I)</italic> and 
 <italic>MHC class II (MHC-II)</italic> genes encode cell-surface glycoproteins involved in the binding and presentation of peptides to the T cell receptors (TCRs) of T lymphocytes. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I proteins present peptides from endogenous sources, such as those derived from viruses, to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas MHC-II molecules mainly present peptides from exogenous sources, such as those derived from extracellular pathogens, to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. These tri-molecular interactions of MHC, peptide, and TCR are central to the generation of antigen-specific immune responses.
