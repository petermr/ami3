<p>In a uveal melanoma tumor cell line it was demonstrated for the first time that histone methylation played an important role in 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> transcriptional silencing (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>). The strongly reduced expression levels of CIITA after IFNγ-induction were found to correlate with high levels of the repressive 3meK27-H3 histone modification in CIITA-PIV chromatin in the absence of CpG dinucleotide methylation of CIITA-PIV DNA (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>). Moreover, the KMTase Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2, or KMT6) was recruited to relative high levels into CIITA-PIV chromatin (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>). KMT6 is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays an important role in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of cellular identity. Consistent with the transcriptional silent state of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> was the lack of RNA polymerase II recruitment into CIITA-PIV chromatin after IFNγ-induction (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>). RNA interference-mediated silencing of expression of KMT6 resulted in an increment in CIITA mRNA expression levels after IFNγ induction. These observations suggest that KMT6 is involved in the transcriptional downregulation of IFNγ-induced expression of CIITA in uveal melanoma (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>). Notably, the transcriptional silencing of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> by histone methylation in the absence of CpG dinucleotide methylation is in line with the observation that the 3meK27-H3 modification pre-marks genes for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> methylation in cancer (Schlesinger et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2007</xref>). It could therefore be argued that the epigenetic make-up of the CIITA-PIV region in uveal melanoma reflects pre-marking for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> methylation of DNA, and that this reflects an intermediate epigenetic state of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> in the complete shut down of MHC-II mediated antigen presentation functions. More recently, lack of CIITA expression was also found associated with high levels of the 3meK27-H3 repressive histone mark in the relative absence of activating histone acetylation and methylation marks in CIITA-PIII chromatin in T leukemia cell lines lacking MHC-II molecule expression (Van Eggermond et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2011</xref>). In contrast, CIITA and MHC-II molecule expressing T lymphoma cells displayed the opposite phenotype. As detailed above, in T leukemia cells these repressive histone marks were also found to be associated with the other CIITA promoters in the 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> multi-promoter region, while the opposite was noted for T lymphoma cells (Van Eggermond et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2011</xref>). The high levels of the repressive histone mark 3meK27-H3 were accompanied by relative high levels of KMT6 at the various CIITA promoters in T leukemia cells, while CIITA expressing T lymphoma cells displayed a general lack of KMT6 (Van Eggermond et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2011</xref>). Additionally, in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells a role for KMT6 in transcriptional silencing of IFNγ-inducible expression of CIITA was also revealed (Mehta et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2011</xref>). Together, these observations provide a clear link with expression of Polycomb Group proteins and transcriptional silencing of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> and resulting lack of expression of MHC-II molecules in cancer.
