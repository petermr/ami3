<p>In dendritic cell maturation chromatin remodeling also plays an important role in the control of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> transcription (Landmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2001</xref>; Choi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>). During differentiation of monocytes into immature dendritic cells the CIITA-PI isoform is induced. In immature dendritic cells, MHC-II molecules are largely retained in intracellular compartments. Upon maturation of dendritic cells, the peptide/MHC-II complexes are assembled and transported to the cell surface. The increase of transported MHC-II molecules at the cell surface is accompanied by rapid transcriptional silencing of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> in matured dendritic cells (Landmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2001</xref>). Like in plasma B cells, the transcriptional inactivation of CIITA-PI is also accompanied by global histone deacetylation involving not only CIITA-PI but also CIITA-PIII and CIITA-PIV (Landmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2001</xref>). In a mouse model activation of CIITA-PI, during differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells by mGM-CSF, is accompanied by an increase in the levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 (Choi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>). IL-10 could block the increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation during differentiation resulting in inhibition of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> transcription (Choi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>). Recently the involvement of the transcriptional repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp-1 in these CIITA-PI silencing processes was revealed (Smith et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>). It was shown that during dendritic cell maturation binding to CIITA-PI of the transcriptional activators PU.1, IRF-8, NF-κB, and Sp-1 is lost while at the same time the transcriptional repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp-1 and its associated co-repressors KMT1C and HDAC2 are recruited to CIITA-PI (Smith et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>). This results in a loss of histone acetylation and acquisition of histone K9-H3 dimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ) at CIITA-PI (Smith et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>). Together, the transcriptional repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp-1 appears to play a central role in the extinction of the various CIITA promoters and therefore can be regarded as a central regulator of MHC-II antigen presentation (Smith et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>).
