<p>Given the essential role of CIITA in 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> transcription, constitutive expression of CIITA coincides with constitutive MHC-II molecule expression in APCs. In non-immune cells expression of CIITA can be induced by IFNγ resulting in inducible MHC-II expression at the cell surface. CIITA therefore can be regarded as a molecular switch for MHC-II expression. Transcriptional activation of 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes also involves modulation of covalent histones modifications and chromatin remodeling (Choi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2011</xref>). As an example, IFNγ-induced MHC-II expression results in an increase in active histone marks, i.e., acetylation of histone H3 and H4, and 3meK4-H3 at the MHC-II promoter, while at the same time a decrease in the repressive 3meK9-H3 histone mark is noted (Chou and Tomasi,
