<p>Boorman and Porterfield subsequently demonstrated transmission of ZIKV to mice and monkeys by

 </xref>). Their study suggests that the extrinsic incubation period for ZIKV in mosquitoes is â‰ˆ10 days. The authors cautioned that their results did not conclusively demonstrate that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes could transmit ZIKV at lower levels of viremia than what might occur among host animals in natural settings. Nevertheless, their results, along with the viral isolations from wild mosquitoes and monkeys and the phylogenetic proximity of ZIKV to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, make it reasonable to conclude that ZIKV is transmitted through mosquito bites.
