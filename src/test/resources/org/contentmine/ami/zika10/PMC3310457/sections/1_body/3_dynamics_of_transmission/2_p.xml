<p class="p">Boorman and Porterfield subsequently demonstrated transmission of ZIKV to mice and monkeys by

  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>). Virus content in the mosquitoes was high on the day of artificial feeding, dropped to undetectable levels through day 10 after feeding, had increased by day 15, and remained high from days 20 through 60 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>). Their study suggests that the extrinsic incubation period for ZIKV in mosquitoes is ≈10 days. The authors cautioned that their results did not conclusively demonstrate that 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes could transmit ZIKV at lower levels of viremia than what might occur among host animals in natural settings. Nevertheless, their results, along with the viral isolations from wild mosquitoes and monkeys and the phylogenetic proximity of ZIKV to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, make it reasonable to conclude that ZIKV is transmitted through mosquito bites.
