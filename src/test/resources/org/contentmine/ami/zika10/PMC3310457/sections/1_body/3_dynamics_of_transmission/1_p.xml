 <italic>Ae. hensilii</italic> was the predominant mosquito species present on Yap during the ZIKV disease outbreak in 2007, but investigators were unable to detect ZIKV in any mosquitoes on the island during the outbreak (

  <italic>2</italic>
 </xref>). Dick noted that 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> mosquitoes, which were abundant and infected with ZIKV in the Zika Forest, were not likely to enter monkey cages such as the one containing Rhesus 766 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">
  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>) raising the doubt that the monkey might have acquired ZIKV from some other mosquito species or through some other mechanism. During the studies of yellow fever in the Zika Forest, investigators had to begin tethering monkeys in trees because caged monkeys did not acquire yellow fever virus when the virus was present in mosquitoes (

 </xref>). Thus, despite finding ZIKV in 
 <italic>Ae. Africanus</italic> mosquitoes, Dick was not sure whether or not these mosquitoes were actually the vector for enzootic ZIKV transmission to monkeys.
