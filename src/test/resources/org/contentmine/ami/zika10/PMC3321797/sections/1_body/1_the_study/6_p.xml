<p>All 11 theca folliculus samples and the isolate were positive for flavivirus by RT-PCR, which was confirmed by amplicon sequencing. The 367-nt sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ641389) of part of the NS3 genomic region obtained from the isolate was 66%–77% identical to the corresponding sequence of viruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese encephalitis virus groups. The amplicon sequences from the 11 theca folliculus samples shared 98%–100% identity with the YY5 isolate. PCR testing of another 52 samples from diseased ducks from the 4 provinces detected flavivirus-specific RNA in 29 samples. Overall, 40 (63.5%) of 63 samples were positive for flavivirus. Flavivirus-specific RNA was most frequently detected in theca folliculi, followed by intestinal mucosa, uterus, spleen, trachea, cloaca (swab), and liver (
