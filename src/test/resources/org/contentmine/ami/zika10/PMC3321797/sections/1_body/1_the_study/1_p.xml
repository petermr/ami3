<p>During the outbreak, we examined 11 diseased ducks (7 Pekin ducks, 3 Cherry Valley Pekin ducks, and 1 Shaoxing duck) from 5 duck farms in 4 provinces. At necropsy, viscera samples (e.g., brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, theca folliculi) were collected and placed in 10% buffered formalin. Sections were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The theca folliculi from each duck were also used for virus isolation or detection by PCR.</p>
