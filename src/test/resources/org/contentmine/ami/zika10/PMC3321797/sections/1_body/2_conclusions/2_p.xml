<p>In this study, we found TMUV-specific RNA in 63.5% samples from diseased ducks in different provinces. In particular, it was found in 14 (93.3%) of 15 theca folliculus samples, suggesting that reproductive tissues may be a major site for viral persistence, replication, or both. Experimental infections further confirmed that TMUV can be reisolated from theca folliculi. These results suggested that TMUV may be the causative agent of duck hemorrhagic ovaritis.</p>
