<p>After samples underwent several rounds of screening and identification attempts, we concluded that a new virus infection was the most likely cause of the disease. One virus strain, designated YY5, was isolated from the Shaoxing duck after inoculation of clarified theca folliculus suspension into the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old specific pathogen–free chicken embryos. The embryos died 72–120 hours after inoculation, and severe cutaneous hemorrhages were observed.</p>
