<p>To investigate the genetic relationship of the isolate with flaviviruses, we obtained the genomic sequence of a 1,035-bp segment at the 3′ terminus of the NS5 gene (GenBank accession no. HQ641390) from strain YY5 by RT-PCR and primers FU1 and cFD3 as described (

 </xref>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that YY5 was more closely related to TMUV than to other flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Comparative sequence analysis showed that YY5 was 87%–91% identical to different strains of TMUV; therefore, we classified the flavivirus isolated from ducks as a new genotype of TMUV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Ntaya virus group.
