<p>Because eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus has been shown to cause paralysis in Pekin ducks (

 </xref>), we performed EEE virus–specific nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (

  <italic>2</italic>
 </xref>) to detect the isolate. RNA was extracted by using the TranZol RNA Extraction Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The primer pairs used to amplify the E2 gene of EEE virus (EEE-4 and cEEE-7, EEE-5 and cEEE-6) have been described (

Unexpectedly, a 221-nt sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ641388) was shown to encode the nonstructural (NS) 1 protein of flavivirus, which exhibited 73%–85% identity to flaviviruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese encephalitis virus groups, such as Bagaza virus (GenBank accession no. ACG60714 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">

 </xref>],) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (GenBank accession no. ABN11829 [
 <italic>4</italic>]). The result demonstrated the possible presence of a flavivirus in ducks.
