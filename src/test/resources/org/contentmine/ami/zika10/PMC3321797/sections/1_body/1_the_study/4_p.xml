<p class="p">Because eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus has been shown to cause paralysis in Pekin ducks (

Unexpectedly, a 221-nt sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ641388) was shown to encode the nonstructural (NS) 1 protein of flavivirus, which exhibited 73%–85% identity to flaviviruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese encephalitis virus groups, such as Bagaza virus (GenBank accession no. ACG60714 [

  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
