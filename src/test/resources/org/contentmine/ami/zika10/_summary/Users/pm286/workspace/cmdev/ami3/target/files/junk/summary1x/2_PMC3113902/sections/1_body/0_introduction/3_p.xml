<p>The MHC-II genes encode the polymorphic HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP molecules, which are expressed as α- and β-chain heterodimers on the cell surface. MHC-II molecules are central in the initiation of cellular and humoral immune responses, but they have also been implicated as contributing factors for a variety of autoimmune disorders. In contrast to the classical MHC-I molecules, which are expressed in a constitutive fashion on almost all nucleated cells, the constitutive expression of MHC-II molecules is tissue-specific and is restricted to professional antigen presenting cells (APCs, i.e., dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells) and in thymic epithelial cells (Van den Elsen et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2002</xref>). Because of their crucial role in the immune response, the genes encoding MHC-I and MHC-II molecules are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level both by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
