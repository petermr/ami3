 <bold>b) </bold>The presented results could suggest that 
 <bold>TPBIA </bold>acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist in the central nervous system. The tosyl group in 
 <bold>TPBIA</bold>, which plain was found to be perpendicular to that of the indole ring in its low energy conformation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] is important to the differentiation of the biological profile between compounds 
 <bold>PBIA </bold>and 
 <bold>TPBIA</bold>. The association of increasing molecular weight with increasing antagonistic power is well known. An antagonist is always bulkier than the corresponding agonist and it is obvious that the likelihood of forming extra van der Waals bonds with the receptor increases the chances of the bulkier molecule having a longer retention time. Because a molecule's kinetic energy of translation (which is an important factor in desorption) does not change with increase in molecular weight, any gain in size by the molecule increases its time of residence on the receptor [
