<p>The experiments were conducted according to a previous reported methodology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hepatic microsomal fractions prepared from untreated male Fischer-344 rats were heat-inactivated (90°C, 90 s) and suspended in Tris-HCl/KCl buffer (50 mM/150 mM, pH 7.4). The incubation mixtures contained the microsomal fraction, corresponding to 0.125 g liver mL
 <sup>-1</sup>, ascorbic acid (0.2 mM) in Tris buffer, and various concentrations (0.01–1 mM) of the tested compounds dissolved in DMSO. An equal volume of the solvent (0.1 mL) was added to the control incubate. The reaction was initiated by adding freshly prepared FeSO
 <sub>4 </sub>solution (10 μM). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 45 min. Aliquots (0.3 mL) of the incubation mixture (final volume 4 mL) were taken at various time intervals. Lipid peroxidation was assayed spectrophotometrically (535 nm against 600 nm) by determination of the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive material.
