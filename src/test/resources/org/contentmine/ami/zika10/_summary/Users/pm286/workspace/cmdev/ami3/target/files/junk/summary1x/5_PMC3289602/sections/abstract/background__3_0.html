         <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus distributed throughout much of Africa
            and Asia. Infection with the virus may cause acute febrile illness that clinically
            resembles dengue fever. A recent study indicated the existence of three geographically
            distinct viral lineages; however this analysis utilized only a single viral gene.
            Although ZIKV has been known to circulate in both Africa and Asia since at least the
            1950s, little is known about the genetic relationships between geographically distinct
            virus strains. Moreover, the geographic origin of the strains responsible for the
            epidemic that occurred on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia in 2007, and
            a 2010 pediatric case in Cambodia, has not been determined.</p>

         <p>To elucidate the genetic relationships of geographically distinct ZIKV strains and
            the origin of the strains responsible for the 2007 outbreak on Yap Island and a 2010
            Cambodian pediatric case of ZIKV infection, the nucleotide sequences of the open reading
            frame of five isolates from Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal collected
            between 1947 and 2010 were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these and previously
            published ZIKV sequences revealed the existence of two main virus lineages (African
            and Asian) and that the strain responsible for the Yap epidemic and the Cambodian
            case most likely originated in Southeast Asia. Examination of the nucleotide and amino
            acid sequence alignments revealed the loss of a potential glycosylation site in some
            of the virus strains, which may correlate with the passage history of the virus.</p>

         <p>The basal position of the ZIKV strain isolated in Malaysia in 1966 suggests that the
            recent outbreak in Micronesia was initiated by a strain from Southeast Asia. Because
            ZIKV infection in humans produces an illness clinically similar to dengue fever and
            many other tropical infectious diseases, it is likely greatly misdiagnosed and underreported.</p>
