<p>Over the past years, several regulatory elements in 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> promoters and interacting factors that are important for transcriptional activation have been identified (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). IFNγ-mediated activation of CIITA-PIV requires occupation of the gamma-activated sequence (GAS)-box and the ISRE in CIITA-PIV by STAT-1 and the STAT-1 target gene IRF-1 (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1998</xref>). Importantly, STAT-1 needs to interact with USF-1 bound to the E-box adjacent to the GAS-box for stable interaction (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1998</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The IFNγ-mediated activation of CIITA-PIV also results in increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at CIITA-PIV (Morris et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2002</xref>). Interestingly, this increase in histone acetylation in CIITA-PIV chromatin is already noted prior to recruitment of IRF-1 to the CIITA-PIV promoter (Morris et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2002</xref>). In addition to the factors interacting with these CIIT-PIV promoter elements, the SWI/SNF ATPase BRG-1 was also found to be an important factor in the IFNγ-mediated transcriptional activation of CIITA-PIV because cells that lack expression of BRG-1 failed to induce CIITA expression following exposure to IFNγ (Pattenden et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2002</xref>).
