<p>Transcriptional regulation of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic>, the gene encoding CIITA, is mediated through the activity of four independent promoter units (CIITA-PI through CIITA-PIV; Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1997</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These promoter units are employed in a cell type- and activation-specific manner. CIITA-PI and CIITA-PIII are used for the constitutive expression in dendritic cells and in B cells, respectively (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1997</xref>). CIITA-PIV has been shown to be the promoter predominantly involved in IFNγ-inducible expression (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1998</xref>; Piskurich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">1999</xref>). In addition, in human non-B cells, CIITA-PIII can also be activated by IFNγ through an element located 2 kb upstream of the core CIITA-PIII promoter (Piskurich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">1999</xref>; Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2002a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">2007</xref>). CIITA-PIII has also been shown to be employed by human T cells upon activation (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2002</xref>; Wong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2002</xref>). The promoter function of CIITA-PII is still ill-defined. The various 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> promoters each transcribe a unique first exon and are located within a region of approximately 14 kb (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1997</xref>).
