<p>Activation of 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> genes, with the exception of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic>, is mediated by several conserved cis-acting regulatory promoter elements: i.e., the enhancer A, interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and the SXY-module (comprising the S/W, X1, X2, and Y-boxes; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These conserved regulatory elements play an important role in the inducible and constitutive expression of 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> genes (Van den Elsen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2004</xref>). Interestingly, these regulatory elements are also involved in the transcriptional activation of the β2-microglobulin promoter but not of the promoters of the genes encoding the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and the large multifunctional protease (LMP), which are essential components in the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway (Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>; Van den Elsen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2004</xref>). In MHC-I promoters, the enhancer A is bound by nuclear factor (NF)-κB, while the ISRE is bound by interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1999</xref>). The transcription factors NF-κB and IRF-1 are mediators of the TNFα and IFNγ (Janus-family kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, Jak/STAT) routes of gene activation, respectively, which account for the induced 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> transcription. Additionally, binding sites for upstream-stimulatory factor (USF)-1, -2 and for the transcription factor Sp-1 can also be found within these upstream regulatory promoter elements in a locus and allele-specific fashion (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1999</xref>). As a result of nucleotide sequence variation in the enhancer A and the ISRE in the different MHC-I promoters the level of promoter activation induced by these pathways differs among the various 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> loci (Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1999</xref>; Girdlestone, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2000</xref>; Johnson,
