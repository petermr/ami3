 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">Williams (2004)</xref> noted the infestation to be in its early stages in 2003, and estimated the species to have arrived in the area some three to five years earlier. Additional collections were made in 2004 in Boundary Bay (Lim s.n., V-two specimens) and on Roberts Banks (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Ducks Unlimited Canada 2010</xref>). It is currently reproducing by seed production and vegetatively by outward clonal growth forming meadows and by drifting plant parts (R. Knight, personal communication 2010). There are only a few herbarium collections documenting
