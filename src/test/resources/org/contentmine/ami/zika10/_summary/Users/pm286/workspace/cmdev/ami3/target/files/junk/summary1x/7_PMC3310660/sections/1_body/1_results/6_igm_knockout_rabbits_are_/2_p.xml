<p>The Δ1 (male founder 22826) and Δ7 (female founder 22830) mutations in exon 1 both result in frameshifts in the IgM coding region and were predicted to disrupt expression of full-length protein. The founder male 22826 was intercrossed with the founder female 22830 to generate Δ1/Δ7 compound heterozygous animals. Three mutated F1 animals were obtained, one carrying the Δ1 mutation, one carrying the Δ7 mutation, and one Δ1/Δ7 compound heterozygote. The Δ7 mutation was also bred to homozygosity in an F2 generation. Serum IgM and IgG levels in these animals were determined by ELISA at 10 weeks of age. IgM and IgG levels were similar to wild type in Δ1 and Δ7 heterozygotes, but were undetectable in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits (

The peripheral B-cell population in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits was characterized by FACS analysis; only ∼0.1% of PBMCs stained positive for surface IgM (sIgM), and sIgG positive PBMCs were completely absent. In contrast, control wild type animals showed 21.4% of PBMC positive for sIgM and 0.7% positive for sIgG, typical for rabbit blood. A rabbit pan B-cell specific antibody
