<p>The SXY-module is also present is the promoters of 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> and its accessory genes (
 <italic>invariant chain</italic>, 
 <italic>HLA-DM</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-DO</italic>). However, MHC-II promoters differ from MHC-I promoters in that they lack the typical enhancer A and ISRE (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The sequence and stereo-specific alignment of the various boxes in the SXY-module is highly conserved and critical for its functioning in constitutive and inducible-transcriptional activation of 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> and 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes (Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>; Ting and Trowsdale, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2002</xref>). The SXY-module is cooperatively bound by a multi-protein complex containing regulatory factor X (RFX; consisting of RFX5, RFXB/ANK, and RFXAP; Steimle et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">1995</xref>; Durand et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1997</xref>; Masternak et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1998</xref>; Nagarajan et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">1999</xref>), CREB/ATF (Moreno et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1999</xref>; Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>), and nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y; Louis-Plence et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1997</xref>; Jabrane-Ferrat et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2002</xref>). This complex acts as an enhanceosome driving transactivation of these genes (Masternak et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2000</xref>; Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>; Choi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2011</xref>). The presence of the RFX components is crucial for the assembly of this enhanceosome, a notion that has been derived from studies with cell lines established from MHC-II deficiency patients (Reith and Mach, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2001</xref>). In addition to these factors that assemble directly to the X1, X2, and Y-box sequences the class II transactivator (CIITA), which acts as a co-activator, is also required. CIITA is essential for 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> transcription (Steimle et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">1993</xref>), while it contributes to the activation of MHC-I promoters (Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>; Martin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1997</xref>). CIITA belongs to the large NLR (nucleotide binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing) family of proteins that play multiple functions in innate immune responses (Harton et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2002</xref>; Ting et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2008</xref>). Despite the fact that CIITA activates MHC-I promoters 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> contribution to 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> gene transcription remained enigmatic. It is therefore of note that more recently the NLR family member NLRC5 was identified to associate with and activate the promoters of 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> genes and not 
 <italic>MHC-II</italic> genes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Meissner et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2010</xref>). Like CIITA, NLRC5 also induced the expression of the gene encoding Î²2-microglobulin. However, in contrast to CIITA, NLRC5 was also found to control the expression of the genes encoding TAP and LMP. These observations reveal that NLRC5 appears to be a transcriptional regulator, which orchestrates the concerted expression of critical components in the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway (Meissner et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2010</xref>).
