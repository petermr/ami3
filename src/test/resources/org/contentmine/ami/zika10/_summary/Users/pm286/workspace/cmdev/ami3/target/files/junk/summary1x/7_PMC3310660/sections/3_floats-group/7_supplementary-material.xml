   <bold>IgM sequence polymorphisms in different rabbit strains.</bold> The DNA sequence of the genomic IgM locus in 14 rabbits was determined; 6 rabbits of the ZIKA strain, 2 of the Alicia strain 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Knight1">[48]</xref>, which carry a mutation in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, and 6 of mixed breed (NZW/ZIKA/Alicia) carrying the Basilea 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Lamoyi1">[49]</xref> loss-of-function mutation at the immunoglobulin kappa light chain locus, which is on a different chromosome. Exon sequences are underlined (Exons: E1–E4). Polymorphisms are shaded in grey (R: A or G; Y: C or T). Five sequence polymorphisms were found in E1, two in E2, four in E3 and one in E4. The binding sites of the ZFNs used for microinjection are highlighted in red.
