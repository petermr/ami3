<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide up-to-date taxonomic information for specimen-based identification of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> species in the Pacific Northwest. Although field-based identification of invasive 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> taxa is possible, reliable determinations should be made or confirmed from specimens, as most of the diagnostic characters require magnification and careful, accurate measurements. Specimens should be deposited in herbaria, where they become part of the scientific record, are available for study by other scientists, and document the distributions of species in time and space. Voucher specimens for invasive plants such as 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> are particularly important, as they provide the raw materials from which reliable and repeatable identifications can be made, and they contribute to long-term understanding of the distribution and spread of these new
 <!--PageBreak--> invaders. Unfortunately, herbaria often have relatively few specimens of weedy species, a situation recently documented for noxious weeds in Washington (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">Zika 2006</xref>). Accordingly, there are relatively few herbarium specimens for invasive 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> taxa in the Pacific Northwest, despite considerable efforts to eradicate 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> infestations (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Hedge et al. 2003</xref>), effectively representing the collection of hundreds to thousands of plants.
