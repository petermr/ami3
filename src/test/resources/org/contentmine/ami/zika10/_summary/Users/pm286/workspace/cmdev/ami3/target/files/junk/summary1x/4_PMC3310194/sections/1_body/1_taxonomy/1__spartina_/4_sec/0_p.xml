<p>Plants perennial, culms cespitose from knotty bases or solitary from conspicuous creeping rhizomes. Leaves cauline; sheaths open; ligules a line of hairs; blades flat to involute. Inflorescences with multiple branches (i.e., spikes) inserted along a main axis, branches usually alternate, appressed to spreading. Spikelets laterally compressed, one-flowered, arranged in two rows along two sides of a more or less triquetrous axis, disarticulating below the glumes. Glumes unequal, strongly keeled; lower glumes 1-veined, shorter than upper glumes and floret; upper glumes 1–6-veined, usually longer than the floret. Lemmas 1–3-veined, keeled, shorter than the paleas. Paleas 2-veined, thin and papery, longer than the lemma. Anthers 3. Styles 2. Caryopses linear. Base chromosome number,
