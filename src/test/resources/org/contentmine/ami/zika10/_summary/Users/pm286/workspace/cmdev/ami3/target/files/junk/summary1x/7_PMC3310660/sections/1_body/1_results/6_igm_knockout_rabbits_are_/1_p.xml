<p>In the immune response, the first antibodies to appear are of the IgM class. IgG, IgA, or IgE are then generated from IgM via class-switch recombination. Lack of IgM should therefore result in the absence of other isotypes. To determine if this was the case in our rabbits, we generated IgM knockout rabbits by breeding ZFN-treated founders and measured both IgM and IgG in serum.</p>
