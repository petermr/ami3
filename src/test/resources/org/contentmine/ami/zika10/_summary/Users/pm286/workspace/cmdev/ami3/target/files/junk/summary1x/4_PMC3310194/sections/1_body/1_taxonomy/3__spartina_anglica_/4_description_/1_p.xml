<p>Culms 32–104 cm tall, thick, fleshy,rhizomatous, forming clumps and dense swards. Sheaths glabrous, occasionally with short, scattered hairs, when present hairs to 0.2 mm long; ligules 1–3 mm long; blades 6–45 cm long × 4–10 mm wide, flat proximally, moderately to strongly involute distally, divergent 30–60° from culms, adaxial surfaces glabrous, occasionally sparsely pubescent proximally, when present hairs to 0.2 mm long, abaxial surfaces glabrous, occasionally sparsely pubescent proximally, when present hairs to 0.5 mm long, margins smooth. Inflorescences 12–21.5(–31.5) cm long × 7–25 mm wide at midpoint, erect, with (2)3–5(–11) branches; branches (7–)8–15(–20) cm long × (3–)4–5(–6) mm wide, appressed to main axis or ascending; rachises 1–2.2 mm wide between spikelets, extending 2–20 mm beyond the distal spikelet, glabrous, margins glabrous, occasionally sparsely pubescent, when present the hairs 0.2–0.4 mm long. Spikelets (15–)16.5–25 mm long × 1.8–2.5(–2.8) mm wide, weakly appressed, weakly overlapping, calluses (1.5–)2–4.5 mm long. Glumes (weakly) moderately or densely pubescent, hairs 0.1–0.3 mm long, hairs usually denser and to 0.6 mm long proximally; keels scabrous or ciliate, hairs to 0.5 mm long; lower glumes 8–14 mm long × 0.5–0.7 mm wide, 1-veined, tips acute or obtuse; upper glumes 13–22 mm long × 1–1.5 mm wide, 3–6 veined, tips obtuse or acute; lemmas 11–17 mm long, 1–3-veined, appressed pubescent distally, glabrous proximally, margins membranous; paleas exceeding lemmas by 1–2 mm; anthers 7–10 mm long, yellowish, usually fully exserted at maturity, dehiscent, pollen fertile. 2
