<p>Several introductions of

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> have occurred along the west coast of North America where it is not native. The species was reported in 1945 from a single estuarial location in Willapa Bay, Washington, where occasional plants had been observed since around 1911, and thought to have been introduced in the early twentieth century with oyster culture (

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> that occurred in Willapa Bay between 1945 and 2000, and concluded that its rapid colonization likely originated from multiple introductions over several decades, as opposed to the long-standing hypothesis of post-establishment colonization following a single introduction to the region (e.g.,

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Grosholz et al. 2009</xref>), and substantial efforts and resources have been directed at its management, control and eradication (e.g.,

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> is also known from the southern end of Padilla Bay in northwestern Washington, where it was apparently introduced independently between 1941 and 1945 to aid in beach stabilization (see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">Wiggins and Binney 1987</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Riggs 1992</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">Stiller and Denton (1995)</xref> confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of this stand compared with the Willapa Bay population, supporting its putative independent origin.
