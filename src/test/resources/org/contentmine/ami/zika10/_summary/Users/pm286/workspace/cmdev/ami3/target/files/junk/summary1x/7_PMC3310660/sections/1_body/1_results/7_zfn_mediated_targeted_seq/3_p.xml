<p>Oocytes were then injected with 9 ng/µl ZFN 18255/18257 mRNA plus 10 ng/µl IgME1 DNA, and transferred to recipients. Seventeen fetuses were removed at day 15 of gestation and analyzed. All showed normal development, and examination of the uterine horns showed no evidence of degenerate or absorbed conceptuses. DNA was prepared from each fetus and screened by PCR. Three fetuses (2, 7 and 9) showed amplification of a 1.758 kb product across the 5′ junction and a 1.683 kb fragment across the 3′ junction of the target site, consistent with replacement of IgM exon 1 with the PGK neo cassette by homologous recombination, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The identity of the 5′ PCR product was confirmed by restriction digestion, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In addition, the DNA sequence of the 5′ PCR product from fetus 7 was determined and found to be identical to that predicted for the targeted locus, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s002">Figure S2</xref>. Southern hybridization analysis was carried out using genomic DNA from the three PCR positive and five PCR negative fetuses. The Southern blotting scheme is outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g003">Figure 3</xref> and results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s003">Figure S3</xref>. Each of the PCR positive fetuses showed a diagnostic restriction fragment spanning the 3′ junction of the target site, consistent with targeted replacement at the first exon, and also a fragment corresponding to a wild type IgM allele. The five negative fetuses showed only the wild type allele.
