<p>Of the ten rabbits identified as carrying ZFN induced mutant IgM alleles, eight (four males and four females) survived to sexual maturity and were used as founders to produce a F1 generation. Seven F0 rabbits transmitted mutant IgM alleles at frequencies ranging from 1.3% to 50% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t001">Table 1</xref>). Among these, one male (22826) and one female (22821) both carried two independent mutations. The female failed to pass on either mutation to the next generation, but the male transmitted both mutations at a similar rate, suggesting that founder rabbits had different degrees of mosaicism.
