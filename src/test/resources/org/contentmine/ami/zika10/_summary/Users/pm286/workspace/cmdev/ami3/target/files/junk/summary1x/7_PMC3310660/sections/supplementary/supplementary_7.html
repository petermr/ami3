 <caption> IgM sequence polymorphisms in different rabbit strains. The DNA sequence of the genomic IgM locus in 14 rabbits was determined; 6 rabbits of the ZIKA strain, 2 of the Alicia strain [48], which carry a mutation in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, and 6 of mixed breed (NZW/ZIKA/Alicia) carrying the Basilea [49] loss-of-function mutation at the immunoglobulin kappa light chain locus, which is on a different chromosome. Exon sequences are underlined (Exons: E1â€“E4). Polymorphisms are shaded in grey (R: A or G; Y: C or T). Five sequence polymorphisms were found in E1, two in E2, four in E3 and one in E4. The binding sites of the ZFNs used for microinjection are highlighted in red. (TIF) </caption>
