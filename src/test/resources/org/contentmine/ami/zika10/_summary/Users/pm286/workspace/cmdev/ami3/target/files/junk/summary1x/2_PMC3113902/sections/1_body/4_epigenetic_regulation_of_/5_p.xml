<p>Plasma B cells lack expression of CIITA (Silacci et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">1994</xref>). This extinction of CIITA and resulting MHC-II molecule expression during differentiation of B cells into plasma B cells is mediated by the transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1, also known as positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1, PRDI-BF1; Piskurich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2000</xref>; Ghosh et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>). The silencing of CIITA expression in plasma cells is most likely resulting from binding of Blimp-1 to the Ets/ISRE-consensus element in CIITA-PIII thereby disrupting the interaction of PU.1/IRF-4 to this element (Piskurich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2000</xref>; Ghosh et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>; Wright and Ting, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">2006</xref>). Interestingly, besides its repressive activity on CIITA-PIII transactivation, there is more recent evidence that PRDI-BF1 mediates also repression of CIITA-PIV (Chen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2007</xref>). Transcriptional repression of 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> mediated by Blimp-1/PRDI-BF1 is also associated with histone deacetylase and lysine methyltransferase (KMT) activities (Yu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">2000</xref>; Gyory et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>). In particular the activities of the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the lysine methyltransferase KMT1C (also known as G9a), are required in these epigenetic silencing processes. Indeed it was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that differences between B cells and plasma cells exist in the levels of activating and repressive histone marks in CIITA-PIII chromatin (Green et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>). In plasma cells lacking CIITA expression, histone marks associated with gene transcription such as acetylated histone H3 and H4, and 2meK4-H3 and 3meK4-H3 are lost at CIITA-PIII, while the repressive 2meK9-H3 mark is increased (Green et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>). Interestingly these histone marks were found also to exist at CIITA-PI, CIITA-PII and CIITA-PIV, revealing the involvement of the entire 
 <italic>MHC2TA</italic> multi-promoter region. As a consequence of the repressive histone marks and resulting chromatin inaccessibility, the binding of CIITA-PIII interacting transcription factors (i.e., Sp-1, CREB-1, E47, PU.1, IRF-4) was lost in plasma cells (Green et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>).
