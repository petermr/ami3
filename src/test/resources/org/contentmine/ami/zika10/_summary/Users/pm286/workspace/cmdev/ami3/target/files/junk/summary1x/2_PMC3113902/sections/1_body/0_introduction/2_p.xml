<p>The 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> gene cluster encodes the highly polymorphic classical MHC-I molecules (human leukocyte antigen, HLA-A, -B, and -C), which play essential roles in the detection and elimination of virus-infected cells, tumor cells and transplanted allogeneic cells and the less polymorphic non-classical MHC-Ib molecules (HLA-E, -F, and -G). These latter MHC-Ib molecules have specialized immune regulatory functions (Van den Elsen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2004</xref>). All cell-surface expressed MHC-I and MHC-Ib molecules are associated with the non-polymorphic Î²2-microglobulin.
