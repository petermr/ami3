 <bold>c) </bold>Some clinical studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have shown that vitamin E (a well established antioxidant) may be effective in treating TD. However vitamin E does not cross readily the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which could explain why other studies failed to confirm these results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore we considered interesting to investigate the antioxidant potential of the synthesized 
 <bold>TPBIA</bold>. It was found that 
 <bold>TPBIA </bold>completely inhibits the peroxidation of rat liver microsome preparations at the studied concentrations
