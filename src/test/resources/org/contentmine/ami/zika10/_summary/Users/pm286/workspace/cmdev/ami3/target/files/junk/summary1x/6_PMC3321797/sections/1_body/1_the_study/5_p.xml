<p>To further confirm flavivirus as the causative agent of duck hemorrhagic ovaritis, we used PCR to test the isolate and clinical samples with forward primer Usu5454f (5′-ATGGATGAAGCYCATTTCAC-3′) (

 </xref>) and a newly designed reverse primer 5861R (5′-CCAAAGTTGGCYCCCATCTC-3′). The primers were located in the conserved regions of the NS3 sequences of Bagaza virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Usutu virus (

 </xref>–

 </xref>) and were predicted to produce an ≈400-bp amplicon. The reaction conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94°C; followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, annealing at 47°C for 35 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72°C for 10 min. RT-PCR was optimized by using the following controls, including nucleic acids extracted from theca folliculi of healthy Pekin ducks: avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, egg drop syndrome virus, anatid herpesvirus 1, Muscovy duck parvovirus, goose parvovirus, duck reovirus, goose reovirus, duck hepatitis A virus, duck astrovirus, duck circovirus, and goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus.
