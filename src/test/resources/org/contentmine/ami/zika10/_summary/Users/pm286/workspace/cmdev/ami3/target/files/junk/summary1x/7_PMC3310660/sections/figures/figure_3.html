 <caption> Targeted sequence replacement at the IgM locus. The structure of the IgME1 gene targeting vector, regions of homology with the IgM locus, and the predicted structure of the targeted locus are shown. Exons are marked and numbered as open boxes. The ZFN 18255/18257 cleavage site within exon 1 is indicated by a vertical arrow. The 5′ and 3′ junction PCR products are indicated; with positions of primers marked by arrows, and restriction sites for MscI and ApaI marked by (M) and (A), respectively. The hybridization probe and the diagnostic fragments used for Southern analysis are indicated in the lower part of the diagram. HinDIII (H) and BspHI (B) restriction sites are marked. </caption>
