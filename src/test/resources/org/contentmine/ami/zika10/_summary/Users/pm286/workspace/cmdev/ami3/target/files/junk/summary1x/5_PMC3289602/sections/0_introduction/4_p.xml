<p>Zika virus, has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome approximately 11 kilobases in length 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Kuno1">[16]</xref>. The genome contains 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions flanking a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins: the capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM), and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Kuno1">[16]</xref>. A previous genetic study using nucleotide sequences derived from the NS5 gene indicated three ZIKV lineages: East African (one strain examined), West African (three strains examined), and Asian (one strain examined)
