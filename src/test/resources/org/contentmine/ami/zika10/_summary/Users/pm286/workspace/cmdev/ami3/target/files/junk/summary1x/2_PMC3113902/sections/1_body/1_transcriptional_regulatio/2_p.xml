<p>Expression of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> is under normal circumstances confined primarily to fetal trophoblast cells and thymic epithelium. This suggest an alternative transcriptional control of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> than that of the classical 
 <italic>MHC-I</italic> genes. Indeed, while encoding similar regulatory elements in its 5′ DNA, 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> is not regulated by the upstream ISRE and κB sites or the SXY regulatory module (Gobin and Van den Elsen, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1999</xref>). Instead, the HLA-G promoter can be transactivated by the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-1 (Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2002</xref>). This transactivation is mediated by further upstream positioned CRE sites, which can bind CREB-1, activating transcription factor (ATF)-1 and c-Jun 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Gobin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2002</xref>). Since these factors are ubiquitously expressed, the lack of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> expression in cell types other than trophoblast cells must be regulated in a different manner such as by alternative regulatory factors that suppress expression of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> or by epigenetic mechanisms. In this respect it was recently shown that Ras-responsive binding protein-1 (RREB-1) is a transcriptional repressor of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic>, which exerts its function through chromatin remodeling of the 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> locus by virtue of its interaction with subunits of the CtBP complex in cells that lack expression of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> (Flajollet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2009</xref>). Additionally, it has also been demonstrated that treatment of various types of cells lacking 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> expression with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5′-AZA-deoxycytidine results in restoration of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> transcription (Moreau et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2003</xref>). Besides DNA methylation, histone acetylation modifications have also been implicated in the transcriptional control of 
 <italic>HLA-G</italic> in trophoblast cell lines (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2009</xref>).
