For the later treatment, it is known that tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a major limitation of chronic antipsychotic drug therapy at least with older (typical) antipsychotics.</p><p>There is increased awareness of the different ways in which this condition manifests itself and the variety of disabilities that TD produces. Although a substantial research has been stimulated to identify the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of TD, they remain largely elusive. There are several hypotheses about the pathophysiology of TD (dopamine hypersensitivity, neurotoxicity, GABA insufficiency, noradrenergic dysfunction, structural abnormalities)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], however the true mechanism remains unknown.</p><p>The hypothesis of dopamine hypersensitivity proposes that the nigrostriatal dopamine system develops increased sensitivity to dopamine as a consequence of chronic dopamine receptor blockade induced by neuroleptic drugs. There is an increased incidence and prevalence of involuntary hyperkinetic dyskinesia in patients receiving dopamine antagonists in most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] but not all reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Dopamine antagonists usually suppress TD, whereas dopamine agonists aggravate TD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>An alternate, though highly speculative hypothesis, is the proposal that TD is due to neurotoxic effects induced by free radical byproducts from catecholamine metabolism. The basal ganglia, by virtue of their high oxidative metabolism, are vulnerable to membrane lipid peroxidation as a result of the increased catecholamine turnover induced by neuroleptic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is known that vitamin E (a-tocopherol) serves as a free radical scavenger, thus reducing the cytotoxic effects of free radicals. Clinical studies have produced conflicting data in this area. The impression gained from these studies was that while vitamin E is safe and well-tolerated, it confers only modest benefits. Some studies do not support the hypothesis that TD is mediated through free radical damage to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] while others support that vitamin E appears to be effective in reducing the severity of TD, especially in patients who are young and have recently developed TD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Early neuroleptic agents showed great antipsychotic promise initially, however, the induction of extrapyramidal side effects associated with their use constituted a significant problem. Atypical antipsychotics possess a lower extrapyramidal side effects liability and show a better efficacy in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms as well as cognitive disorders associated with schizophrenia. These features have been related to a higher affinity to serotonin receptors. However, they brought about various side effects such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, cholesterol level elevation, and QT interval prolongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>A novel antipsychotic agent with a mechanism of action different from all currently marketed typical and atypical antipsychotics is aripiprazole. This quinoline derivative exerts potent partial agonistic action on D<sub>2 </sub>and 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors and antagonistic properties at 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>receptors. Aripiprazole claims to be the first agent of a third generation of antipsychotics, the so-called "dopamine-serotonin stabilizers"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] we have shown that 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-N,N,-di-n-propyl-1<italic>H</italic>-benz [g]indole-7-amine (<bold>PBIA</bold>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) acts <italic>in vivo </italic>as a functional dopamine receptor partial agonist. It is known that a partial agonist at any dose level can not produce the same maximal biological response as a full agonist even though the partial agonist binds as tightly and as well to the receptor as the full agonist. In sum, a partial agonist has high affinity for its receptor, but low intrinsic activity. <bold>PBIA </bold>is a moderate [<sup>3</sup>H]-spiperone and 8-OH-[<sup>3</sup>H]-DPAT competitor. Spiperone is a selective D<sub>2 </sub>antagonist while 8-OH-DPAT is a selective 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>agonist. This means that <bold>PBIA </bold>expresses a moderate binding affinity at the dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors in <italic>in vitro </italic>competition binding assays.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structure of 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-N,N,-di-n-propyl-1<italic>H</italic>-benz [g]indole-7-amine (PBIA), 1-p-toluenesulfonyl-6,7,8,9-tetrhydro-N,N-di-n-propyl-1<italic>H</italic>-benz [g]indol-7-amine (TPBIA) and 5-OH-DPAT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2832-3-1-1"/></fig><p><bold>PBIA </bold>was designed as a metabolically stable bioisostere of the potent dopamine receptor agonist 5-OH-DPAT, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Phenolic dopamine receptor agonists suffer from poor bioavailability due to rapid metabolic inactivation via conjugation. Thus, an approach which has been pursued to overcome this problem is to develop non phenolic heterocyclic analogues. In this respect, evidence indicates that an indole NH moiety can be a bioisostere of the hydrogen-bonding H donor properties of the phenolic OH group in dopamine agonists. Based on the above, we synthesized <bold>PBIA</bold>.</p><p>In the present work, we tested the derivative <bold>2 </bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), 1-p-toluenesulfonyl-6,7,8,9-tetrhydro-N,N-di-n-propyl-1<italic>H</italic>-benz [g]indol-7-amine (<bold>TPBIA</bold>) for behavioral effects in rats, related to interactions with central dopamine receptors. Because <bold>TPBIA </bold>has an increased lipophilicity and an appropriate polar molecular surface area (PSA) value, we hypothesized that it might be capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier in a considerable degree. Additionally, the presence of the tosyl group might shift the agonistic activity to that of an antagonist. It is documented that increasing the van der Waals molecular volume of an agonist makes it an antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, since free radical and oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] we also investigated the antioxidant potential of <bold>TPBIA</bold>, since there are some reports concerning the role of free radicals in TD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, it becomes interesting to design compounds that maintain antipsychotic efficacy and simultaneously could be free of TD risk.</p><p>The aim of the current study was:</p><p>1) to find if <bold>TPBIA </bold>crosses the blood-brain barrier,</p><p>2) to test the behavioral effects of <bold>TPBIA </bold>with specific focus on neuroleptic effects,</p><p>3) to test its antioxidant activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Synthesis of TPBIA</title><p>Key step of the synthesis was a Mukaiyama type aldol condensation between the dimethyl acetal of 1-(<italic>p</italic>-toluenesulfonyl)pyrrole-3-acetaldehyde and 4-di-<italic>n</italic>-propylamino-1-trimethylsilyloxycyclohexene followed by cycloaromatization under acidic conditions. A detailed description of the procedures can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. TPBIA was isolated as its hydrochloride salt.

The motor activity of the rats was measured between 12-6 pm in an Ugo-Basile activity cage (type 7401) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The Ugo-Basile activity cage (type 7401)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2832-3-1-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>in vitro</title><p>The antioxidant potential of <bold>TPBIA </bold>was investigated in the model of <italic>in vitro </italic>non enzymatic lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The experiments were conducted according to a previous reported methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hepatic microsomal fractions prepared from untreated male Fischer-344 rats were heat-inactivated (90&#x000b0;C, 90 s) and suspended in Tris-HCl/KCl buffer (50 mM/150 mM, pH 7.4). The incubation mixtures contained the microsomal fraction, corresponding to 0.125 g liver mL<sup>-1</sup>, ascorbic acid (0.2 mM) in Tris buffer, and various concentrations (0.01&#x02013;1 mM) of the tested compounds dissolved in DMSO. An equal volume of the solvent (0.1 mL) was added to the control incubate. The reaction was initiated by adding freshly prepared FeSO<sub>4 </sub>solution (10 &#x003bc;M). The mixture was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min. Aliquots (0.3 mL) of the incubation mixture (final volume 4 mL) were taken at various time intervals. Lipid peroxidation was assayed spectrophotometrically (535 nm against 600 nm) by determination of the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive material.</p><p>Antioxidants inhibit the production of malondialdehyde and, therefore, the color produced after addition of 2-thiobarbituric acid is less intense. None of the compounds interfered with the assay, neither with the conjugation of 2-thiobarbituric acid or with the absorption at 535&#x02013;600 nm. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. The UV measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 554 spectrophotometer.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The effect of the <bold>TPBIA </bold>on the motor behavior of non treated and apomorphine pretreated rats are shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.

As such, it is clearly related to the capacity of a compound to form hydrogen bonds. PSA has been established as a valuable physicochemical parameter for the prediction of a number of properties related to the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs. Among these properties are the intestinal absorption and the blood-brain barrier penetration. PSA has been found to be useful in modeling intestinal absorption together with a direct estimate of lipophilicity widely acknowledged as an important factor in transport across membranes. A common measure of the degree of BBB penetration is the ratio of the steady-state concentrations of the drug molecule in the brain and in the blood, usually expressed as log(Cbrain/Cblood). We expect that the increased lipophilicity (calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] ClogP = 6.659) and the small PSA value (calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], 38.9 Angstroems<sup>2</sup>) of this compound will facilitate its central nervous system penetration. Thus by using an equation reported by Clark et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] we found that the steady-state distribution of <bold>TPBIA </bold>between brain and blood is approximately 1000/1 (logBB = 0.58). This computational model contains two variables: PSA and calculated logP, both of which can be rapidly computed. The model could be considered reliable; for example the measured and predicted BBB permeability of the antidepressant drug, amitryptyline were quite similar (experimental logBB = 0.76&#x02013;0.98 and calculated logBB = 0.76). Finally, its low PSA value is a strong indication that it could be used <italic>per os </italic>for systematic use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p><bold>b) </bold>The presented results could suggest that <bold>TPBIA </bold>acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist in the central nervous system. The tosyl group in <bold>TPBIA</bold>, which plain was found to be perpendicular to that of the indole ring in its low energy conformation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] is important to the differentiation of the biological profile between compounds <bold>PBIA </bold>and <bold>TPBIA</bold>. The association of increasing molecular weight with increasing antagonistic power is well known. An antagonist is always bulkier than the corresponding agonist and it is obvious that the likelihood of forming extra van der Waals bonds with the receptor increases the chances of the bulkier molecule having a longer retention time. Because a molecule's kinetic energy of translation (which is an important factor in desorption) does not change with increase in molecular weight, any gain in size by the molecule increases its time of residence on the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p><bold>c) </bold>Some clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have shown that vitamin E (a well established antioxidant) may be effective in treating TD. However vitamin E does not cross readily the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which could explain why other studies failed to confirm these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore we considered interesting to investigate the antioxidant potential of the synthesized <bold>TPBIA</bold>. It was found that <bold>TPBIA </bold>completely inhibits the peroxidation of rat liver microsome preparations at the studied concentrations</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the current study suggest that <bold>TPBIA </bold>crosses the blood-brain barrier, possesses neuroleptic activity and exerts antioxidative activity.
