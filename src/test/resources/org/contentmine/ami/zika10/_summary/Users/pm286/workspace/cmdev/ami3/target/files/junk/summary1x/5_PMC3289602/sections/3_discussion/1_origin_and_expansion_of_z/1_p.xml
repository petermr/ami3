<p>Prior to this study, only two ZIKV strains had been genetically characterized 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Kuno1">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Lanciotti1">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Grard1">[22]</xref>. Our phylogentic analyses with the inclusion of five newly sequenced strains revealed the existence of two major ZIKV lineages. Analyses showed the basal divergence of the African and Asian lineages. Furthermore, results of the present study show that the FSS13025 (Cambodia, 2010), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966) and EC Yap (Micronesia, 2007) strains belong to the Asian lineage, suggesting a recent common ancestor.
