 </italic> has not previously been reported from British Columbia. It is here reported as new for the province on the basis of two collections made in 2006 in in Boundary Bay at sites separated by some 4.4 kilometers (by air)[Taylor 80 (UBC, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>) and Saarela &amp; Percy 791 (CAN, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref>, UBC, Suppl. Fig. 34)]. These appear to be the most recent confirmed reports of the taxon in North America since it was collected at Stanwood, Washington. Herbarium specimens of these collections were initially determined (incorrectly) as 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic>, since 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> was not expected in British Columbia. Subsequent study of this material, in combination with the

 </italic> taxonomic literature and comparisons with specimens of

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> and Old World specimens of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> at CAN and UBC, confirmed the specimens to be 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic>, prompting the current taxonomic study. Pollen in these specimens is sterile, as determined by pollen staining (see discussion under

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), further confirming their identities as 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic>. Specimens from which pollen was extracted and stained with lactophenol cotton blue to assess fertility are identified with the symbol † in the Specimens Examined below.
