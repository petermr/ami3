<p>Several introductions of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> have occurred along the west coast of North America where it is not native. The species was reported in 1945 from a single estuarial location in Willapa Bay, Washington, where occasional plants had been observed since around 1911, and thought to have been introduced in the early twentieth century with oyster culture (

 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> at Willapa Bay is a photograph taken in the early 1940s by T. Scheffer, housed at the California Academy of Sciences Herbarium (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Civille et al. (2005)</xref> concluded that 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> was probably introduced to Willapa Bay between 1893 and the late 1910s via seeds

 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> has expanded dramatically in Willapa Bay and northwards to Grays Harbour and the Copalis River estuary in Washington (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">Stiller and Denton 1995</xref>), radically transforming these tidal ecosystems from mudflats to dense cordgrass swards (e.g.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Davis et al. 2004a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2004b</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Civille et al. (2005)</xref> used historical records and remote sensing to reconstruct the dramatic expansion of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> that occurred in Willapa Bay between 1945 and 2000, and concluded that its rapid colonization likely originated from multiple introductions over several decades, as opposed to the long-standing hypothesis of post-establishment colonization following a single introduction to the region (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">Scheffer 1945</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">Stiller and Denton 1995</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Feist and Simenstad 2000</xref>). Considerable research has been conducted on understanding the invasion dynamics of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> in Willapa Bay (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Davis et al. 2004a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2004b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">Taylor and Hastings 2004</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Grosholz et al. 2009</xref>), and substantial efforts and resources have been directed at its management, control and eradication (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Grevstad et al. 2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">Taylor and Hastings 2004</xref>). 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> is also known from the southern end of Padilla Bay in northwestern Washington, where it was apparently introduced independently between 1941 and 1945 to aid in beach stabilization (see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">Wiggins and Binney 1987</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Riggs 1992</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">Stiller and Denton (1995)</xref> confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of this stand compared with the Willapa Bay population, supporting its putative independent origin.
