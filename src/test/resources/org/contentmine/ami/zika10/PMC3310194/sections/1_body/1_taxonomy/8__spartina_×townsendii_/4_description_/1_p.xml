<p class="p">Culms 46–100 cm tall, thick, fleshy, rhizomatous. Sheaths glabrous; ligules 1–1.5 mm long; blades 6.5–37 cm long × 4–10 mm wide, flat proximally, often involute distally, divergent 30–40° from culms, adaxial surfaces glabrous, occasionally with very sparse hairs proximally, when present hairs to 0.2 mm long, abaxial surfaces glabrous, occasionally with sparse hairs proximally, when present hairs to 0.5 mm long, margins smooth. Inflorescences 10.5–24(–36) cm long × 7–25 mm wide at midpoint, erect, with (2)3–6(–10) branches; branches (6–)7.5–15(–18) cm long × (2.5–)3–4 mm wide, appressed or ascending, rachises 1–1.9 mm wide between spikelets, extending 2–10(–18) mm beyond the terminal spikelet, extension occasionally absent, glabrous, margins glabrous, occasionally with a few marginal hairs, when present hairs to 0.2 mm long. Spikelets 14–17.5 mm long × 1.5–2.5 mm wide, weakly appressed, weakly overlapping, calluses 0.6–1.5(–2) mm long. Glumes weakly to moderately pubescent, hairs 0.1–0.2 mm long, proximal hairs occasionally to 0.6 mm long, keels glabrous, ciliate or scabrous, when present hairs and teeth 0.2–0.5 mm long, usually longest proximally; lower glumes 7–13 mm long × 0.5–0.7 mm wide, 1-veined, tips acuminate or obtuse; upper glumes 12.5–16.5 mm long × 1–1.5 mm wide, 3-veined, tips acuminate or obtuse. Lemmas 9.5–13.5 mm long, 1-3–veined, pubescent distally, glabrous proximally, margins membranous, keels ciliate distally, hairs to 0.2 mm long, glabrous proximally. Paleas exceeding lemmas by ca. 1 mm, glabrous. Anthers 5–7(–8.5) mm long, not or incompletely exserted at maturity, indehiscent, medium to dark brown, pollen sterile; caryopses absent. 2
