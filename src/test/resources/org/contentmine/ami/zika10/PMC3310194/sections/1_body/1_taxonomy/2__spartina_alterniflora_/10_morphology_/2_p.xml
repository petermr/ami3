<p class="p">There is considerable morphological variation in 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic> throughout its native range with northern plants from Canada and Maine tending to have looser inflorescences, weakly overlapping spikelets, and less glume pubescence, and southern plants tighter inflorescences, more strongly overlapping spikelets, and more pubescent glumes. This variation has been recognized taxonomically in the past at the species and infraspecific levels; however, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" class="xref">Mobberley (1956)</xref> demonstrated the variation to be clinal and therefore taxonomically inconsistent, and only a single taxon is now generally accepted (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" class="xref">Barkworth 2003</xref>). Specimens examined from the Pacific coast in Washington have moderately overlapping spikelets.
