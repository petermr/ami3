  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina gracilis</named-content>
 </italic> is a distinctive taxon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). In the Pacific Northwest it is likely to be most readily confused with 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic>, which also grows inland. It is distinguished from 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> by the following combination of characters: upper glumes unawned or short-awned, awns to 2 mm long [vs. distinctly awned upper glumes, awns 3–8 mm long], ciliate glume keels [vs. pectinate glume keels], spikelets 6–11 mm long [vs. 10–25 mm long], ligules 0.5–1 mm long [vs. 1–3 mm long], 3–12 branches per inflorescence [vs. 5–50 branches per inflorescence], and 10–30 spikelets per branch [vs. 10–80 spikelets per branch]. It is distinguished from 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina patens</named-content>
 </italic> by its ciliate glume keels [vs. scabrous glume keels], inconspicuous lateral veins on the upper glumes [vs. conspicuous lateral veins on the upper glumes], most branches 3–6 mm wide [vs. most branches 2–3 mm wide], branches closely appressed to the main axis [vs. branches appressed, ascending or spreading from main axis], and florets more or less equaling the upper glumes in length [vs. florets shorter than the upper glumes]. 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina gracilis</named-content>
 </italic> can be readily separated from 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflora</named-content>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> by its scabrous leaf margins [vs. glabrous leaf margins], and from 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina densiflora</named-content>
 </italic> by its rhizomatous habit [vs. cespitose].
