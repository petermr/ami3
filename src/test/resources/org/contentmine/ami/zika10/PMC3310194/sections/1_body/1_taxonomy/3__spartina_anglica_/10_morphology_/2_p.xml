<p>Overall, plants of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> tend to be larger than those of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic>, including the lengths of reproductive structures useful in distinguishing the taxa. The species can be distinguished with careful measurements on herbarium specimens, though there is some overlap in the diagnostic morphological characteristics. When making a determination, multiple characters should be examined and multiple measurements should be made on a single plant when possible. 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> is distinguished from 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> by its longer spikelets [(15–)16.5–25 mm long vs. 14–17.5 mm long]; longer anthers [7–10 mm long vs. 5–7(–8.5) mm long]; anthers that are fully exserted and dehiscent [vs. anthers that are not or incompletely exserted and indehiscent; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>]; fertile pollen [vs. sterile pollen (see below and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>)]; longer ligules [1–3 mm long vs. 1–1.5 mm long]; 3–6-veined upper glumes [vs. 3-veined upper glumes]; and longer upper glumes [13–22 mm long vs. 12.5–16.5 mm long]. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Marchant (1968a)</xref> observed that leaf blade angle with respect to the culm can be used to differentiate the taxa, as the blades tend to be more erect in 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> [blades forming an angle 30–40° with respect to the culm] and more spreading in S. 
 <italic>anglica</italic> [blades forming an angle of 30–60°with respect to the culm], and this character is noted in many of the recent field identification resources for the Pacific Northwest. Leaf angle is sometimes difficult to determine on herbarium specimens. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Marchant (1968a)</xref> also noted swards of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> in the field (in England) differed from swards of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> as being less dense in tillers (ca. 52/100 cm
 <sup>2 </sup>vs. ca. 96/100 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and having more robust but fewer rhizomes.
