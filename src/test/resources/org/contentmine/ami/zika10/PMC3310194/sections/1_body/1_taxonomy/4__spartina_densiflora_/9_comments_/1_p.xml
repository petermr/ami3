<p>The taxonomy, biogeography, and natural history of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina densiflora</named-content>
 </italic> is reviewed by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Bortolus (2006)</xref>. The synonymy presented here is not complete; several taxa described from South America are considered to be synonyms by

 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina montevidensis</named-content>
 </italic> Arech. (see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Carrasco et al. 2002</xref> for the location of a probable type specimen), 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina patagonica</named-content>
 </italic> Speg., and several taxa described by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">St-Yves (1932)</xref>. A modern taxonomic revision is needed for 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina densiflora</named-content>
 </italic> to clarify its taxonomy and morphological variation throughout its range (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Bortolus 2006</xref>), particularly given its rapidly increasing global footprint.
