    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Hubbard (1978)</xref>, 
    <italic>Hubbard S.17868A</italic>, is mounted on two sheets at K: K000710269 and K000710270. The latter is clearly labeled ‘sheet II’, but the former is not reciprocally cross-labeled as ‘sheet I’ therefore the two sheets are duplicates according to the Code. The specimen indicated as ‘sheet II” is more robust, and is here designated as the lectotype.
