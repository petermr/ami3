<p>This taxonomic study was prompted by difficulties encountered in determining recent herbarium collections of invasive

 </italic> invasions are causing serious ecological damage on the Pacific coast, there has been considerable effort to develop information sources for field-based identification, probably in response to a lack of easy-to-use and easy-to-access locally relevant information in the scientific literature, in combination with an urgent need for information to facilitate

 </italic> identification by as broad a user group as possible to minimize the impacts of the invasions. These mostly emphasize vegetative characteristics easy to observe in the field, such as plant height, blade width and height, leaf color, and plant habit (e.g.,

Several of these resources do not clearly list authors, publication dates or places other than websites, and they do not identify the original sources (e.g., floras, the primary literature, herbarium specimens) from which the information was derived.
