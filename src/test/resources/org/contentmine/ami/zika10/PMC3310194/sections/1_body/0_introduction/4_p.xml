<p>Here, I present a taxonomic synopsis of the two native and five introduced taxa of

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>

 </italic> Link, and 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic>). I provide a new taxonomic key for the region, nomenclature for all taxa, including previously unpublished details on several type specimens and new lectotypifications, references to published illustrations that clearly show diagnostic characters, specimen citations, and notes on how to distinguish the taxa. New descriptions are given for the closely related and morphologically similar taxa

 </italic>, 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic>, and 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina densiflora</named-content>
 </italic>, which has recently appeared in British Columbia. 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> is newly reported from British Columbia. The descriptions and keys are based on study of specimens collected within and outside the region, in consultation with the global primary and secondary taxonomic literature; these data should be useful for distinguishing the taxa wherever they occur globally, including in Alaska where 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> has not been reported but is anticipated to become a problem in the future (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Morgan and Sytsma 2010</xref>). I also include detailed reviews of the evolutionary origins and introduction histories of the invasive 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> taxa, with a focus on their introductions in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. To facilitate species identification, images of exemplar herbarium specimens of each taxon are included in the main text, and images of fifty herbarium specimens (a subset of the material examined) are included as supplementary information.
