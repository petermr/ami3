  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina foliosa</named-content>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Callaway and Josselyn 1992</xref>). Substantial evidence has accumulated indicating that the two taxa have successfully interbred producing a highly invasive fertile hybrid capable of backcrossing with its parental taxa, resulting in a genetically heterogeneous hybrid cordgrass swarm (i.e., 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina alterniflor</named-content>
 </italic>a × 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina foliosa</named-content>
 </italic>) that is much more invasive than either parental taxon (
