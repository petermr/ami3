  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> requires confirmation (Snohomish Co., Davis Slough west of Stanwood, 25 Aug 1990, M.Arnot 254, WTU-317391, not seen). A 2005 collection from Washington originally identified as

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Kozloff (2005)</xref> also included 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> (as well as 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic>) in his Pacific Northwest flora, indicating only ‘coastal salt marshes’ for its distribution. There apparently are no published data on the current status of the Stanwood population. If the population at Stanwood persists, new collections should be made to document its continued existence at the site, and if other populations are known or discovered, herbarium collections should be made to document their existences.
