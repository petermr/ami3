<p class="p">Culms to 250 cm tall, rhizomatous. Sheaths glabrous; ligules 1–2 mm long; blades 5–63 cm long × 3–10 mm wide at base, usually flat proximally, involute distally, divergent from stems 15–18°, adaxial and abaxial surfaces glabrous, margins smooth, rarely with occasional scabrous teeth. Inflorescences (6–)11–33 cm long × (5–

Spikelets 8–14(–16.5) mm long × 1–2 mm wide, alternate, weakly appressed, weakly or moderately overlapping, calluses 0.5–1.5 mm long. Glumes glabrous or weakly pubescent, when present hairs to 0.2 mm long, proximal hairs sometimes denser and longer to 0.5 mm, keels glabrous or ciliate, when present hairs to 0.3 mm long, margins glabrous; lower glumes 4–9 mm long × 0.2–0.5 mm wide, 1-veined, tips acute; upper glumes 7–14 mm long × 1–1.2 mm wide, 5–7-veined, tips acuminate or obtuse. Lemmas 7–12 mm long, glabrous or scabrous; paleas exceeding lemmas by up to 1 mm; anthers 3–6 mm long, yellow, exserted at maturity, dehiscent, pollen fertile. 2
