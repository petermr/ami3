 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">Williams 2004</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">Williams (2004)</xref> noted the infestation to be in its early stages in 2003, and estimated the species to have arrived in the area some three to five years earlier. Additional collections were made in 2004 in Boundary Bay (Lim s.n., V-two specimens) and on Roberts Banks (

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> in British Columbia, extensive field surveys and mapping exercises were undertaken to determine the extent of the species at Roberts Bank and in Boundary Bay, and an eradication plan was implemented (Dresen et al. 2010; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">Williams et al. 2010</xref>). Despite removal and eradication efforts, by 2009

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Ducks Unlimited Canada 2010</xref>). It is currently reproducing by seed production and vegetatively by outward clonal growth forming meadows and by drifting plant parts (R. Knight, personal communication 2010). There are only a few herbarium collections documenting 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> in the province, collected by G. Williams and P. Lim when the taxon was first found. Additional collections should be made at these and other sites where the species is found, to properly document its continued existence and spread.
