<p>Determining pollen fertility by staining anthers with lactophenol cotton blue is a useful way to distinguish male sterile hybrid plants from those that are fertile, as the cytoplasm of fertile pollen grains readily takes up the stain whereas sterile (i.e., aborted) pollen grains do not. Pollen staining is thus an effective, though more technically involved method, to definitively distinguish the fertile

 </italic> from the sterile F1 hybrid 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic>, as demonstrated by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Marchant (1968a)</xref>. To confirm identifications of these taxa here, and to demonstrate the utility of this technique, I determined pollen fertility for multiple herbarium specimens of 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> using lactophenol cotton blue; collections examined in this manner are identified with the symbol † in the specimen list below and under 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic>. One to three anthers were sampled from a spikelet on each specimen, and these were macerated with forceps in a drop of water on a glass slide to release the pollen. One or a few drops of lactophenol cotton blue were added to the slide and after sitting for a minimum of ten minutes, the slides were examined at 20× to 60× magnification with a compound microscope. In general, the number of pollen grains recovered per specimen

 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic> that had been collected during or after dehiscence, fewer pollen grains were available for study, whereas in 
 <italic>
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> dehiscence does not occur and abundant pollen grains were recovered from the anthers. In fertile pollen grains the cytoplasm was evidently visible and stained, whereas in sterile pollen there was no or little evidence of cytoplasmic staining (
