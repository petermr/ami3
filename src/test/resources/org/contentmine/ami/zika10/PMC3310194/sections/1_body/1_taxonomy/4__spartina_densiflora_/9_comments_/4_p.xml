 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Barkworth 2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Kozloff 2005</xref>), but is included in the online E-Flora BC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Anonymous 2011</xref>). In the Bayne’s Sound region, only a few herbarium collections documenting the species have been made; these are from Fanny Bay (Lomer 5723, CAN, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and the Buckley Bay Ferry Terminal (Lomer 7377, CAN). Some data on the extent of the invasion are given by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Morgan and Sytsma (2010)</xref> and Dresen et al. (2010), who mapped the species in Bayne’s Sound where the extent of its local distribution ranges from individual plants to multiple five meter patches. Detailed characterization of this invasion has not otherwise appeared in the literature.
