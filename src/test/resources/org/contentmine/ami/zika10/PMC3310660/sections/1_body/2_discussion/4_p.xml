<p>ZFN-mediated mutagenesis of the IgM locus in rabbit oocytes was efficient, yielding up to 30% mutant animals in the founder generation. Seven of eight founders passed on mutant alleles to their progeny. We also assessed whether ZFN-mediated targeted sequence replacement could be carried out directly in the oocyte without subsequent selection for the desired event, as recently described in mice 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Meyer1">[23]</xref>. Our results show targeted sequence replacement in rabbit at a rate of up to 18% in fetuses. The frequency of ZFN mediated homologous recombination events we observed was therefore at least equal to that described in mouse (1.7â€“4.5%, Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Meyer1">[23]</xref>) and clearly higher than the rate of approximately 1 in 500 reported in mouse zygotes without ZFN 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Brinster1">[45]</xref>. These results suggest that the technique should be generally applicable, opening the way for the full repertoire of sophisticated gene replacement and modification techniques developed in mouse ES cells. ZFN-mediated genome editing does not require expression at the targeted locus and our data show that regions of homology as short as 1 kb or less, easily obtained by PCR amplification, are sufficient for efficient targeted sequence replacement. With less than 2 kb of total homology, our IgM gene targeting vector was considerably shorter than those described by Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Meyer1">[23]</xref>, but similar to those used for ZFN-mediated gene targeting in human transformed
