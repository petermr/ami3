<p>Rodents, rabbits and other mammals all have particular limitations and strengths for biomedical research and are best regarded as complementary. Parallel and comparative studies performed in more than one species will speed progress in disease research and provide more reliable evaluation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Gene targeting in ES cells is established in mouse and now in rat 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-McCreath1">[3]</xref>, but has so far been elusive in rabbit. Our approach circumvents the need for ES cells or SCNT to carry out precise alterations in any gene, because ZFNs can be designed against any native locus of interest 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Urnov1">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Carroll1">[47]</xref>. This achievement removes a major block to the development of genetically altered research models in those species where ES and SCNT technologies are not available. Furthermore, unlike ES cell-based methods, the desired genetic change can be introduced directly into the animal strain of choice, and heterozygous individuals obtained in the first generation. We are confident that this can be applied to other rabbit genes and other mammals, including important livestock species such as pigs. The possible applications are manifold.
