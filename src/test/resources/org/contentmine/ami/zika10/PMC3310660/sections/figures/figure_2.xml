  <p class="p">A. The top panels show representative dot plot profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a wild type rabbit stained with antibodies specific for surface IgM (left) and surface IgG (right). Lower panels show Δ1/Δ7 PBMCs stained with the same antibodies. B. The upper dot plot shows wild type PBMCs immunostained with RACT30A, an antibody that recognizes a rabbit B-cell specific surface protein

Dot plot profiles showing wild type (left) and Δ7/Δ7 (right) PBMCs, stained intracellularly for the B cell receptor component CD79a. The percentage of gated B cells (IgM
