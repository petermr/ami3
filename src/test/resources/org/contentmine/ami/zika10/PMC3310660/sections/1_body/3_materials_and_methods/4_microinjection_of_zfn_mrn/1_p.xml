<p>Animals used as oocyte donors for the gene inactivation experiments were homozogous Alicia/homozogous Basilea back-crossed for several generations onto the ZIKA background. Alicia (Ali) rabbits carry a natural deletion within the IgH locus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Knight1">[48]</xref> and homozygous Basilea (Bas) animals do not express Igκ, due to a non-functional splice acceptor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Lamoyi1">[49]</xref>. ZIKA rabbits were used as oocyte donors for the gene replacement experiments. Pronuclear stage fertilized oocytes were obtained by flushing oviducts 21 to 24 hrs from female rabbits superovulated by PMSG (Intergonan; Intervet) and hCG (Ovogest; Intervet) injection, inseminated artificially or by natural cover.
