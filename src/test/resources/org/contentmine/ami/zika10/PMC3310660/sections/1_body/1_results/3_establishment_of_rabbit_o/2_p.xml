<p>We then examined technical parameters that could affect embryo viability and the levels of ZFN activity. These included ZFN mRNA concentration, site of microinjection (cytoplasm or pronucleus), and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> polyadenylation of mRNA. Injected embryos were cultured 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and monitored visually for development up to blastocyst stage. Exons 1 or 2 of the IgM locus were then amplified from blastocysts by nested PCR. Results indicated that: the optimal mRNA concentration range was between 3 to 6 ng/µl; microinjection of non-polyadenylated mRNA did not lead to effective mutagenesis; and microinjection into the pronucleus did not lead to effective mutagenesis (shown for exon 1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s005">Table S2</xref>). For gene inactivation experiments we therefore microinjected a 1∶1 mixture of polyadenylated mRNAs coding for the two components of a ZFN heterodimer, diluted to a total of 3 to 5 ng/µl in 0.1 mM EDTA, into the cytoplasm of pronuclear stage fertilized rabbit oocytes.
