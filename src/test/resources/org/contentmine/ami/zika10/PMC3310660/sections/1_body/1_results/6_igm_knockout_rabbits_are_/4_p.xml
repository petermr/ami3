<p>These results show that ZFN-induced knockout alleles of the rabbit IgM gene transmit normally through the germline, and in homozygous form result in animals that are IgM- and IgG-deficient, but otherwise do not display obvious phenotypic abnormalities. It remains to be elucidated what effect the loss of IgM and IgG has on overall immunological function in these rabbits.</p>
