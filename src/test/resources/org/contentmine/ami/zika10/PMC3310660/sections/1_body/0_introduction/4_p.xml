<p>Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are new tools that promise to radically simplify gene knockout and targeted gene replacement. An appropriately designed ZFN can create a double-strand break at a single predetermined site in the genomic DNA of an organism. In eukaryotes, double-strand break repair pathways often create small insertions and deletions at the break site, a useful means of inactivating genes of interest (for review, see Urnov et al.
