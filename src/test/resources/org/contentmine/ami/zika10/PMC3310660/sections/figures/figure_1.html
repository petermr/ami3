 <caption> ZFN-mediated disruption of rabbit IgM. A. Recognition sequences in the rabbit IgM locus for ZFNs used in this study. B. Screening data using a budding yeast proxy system (see Materials and Methods) for ZFNs shown in panel A. The first sample represents positive control ZFNs that target the human CCR5 locus [51]. The grey and black bars represent reporter gene correction levels at low and high levels of ZFN synthesis, respectively. As detailed in Doyon et al. [18], the ZFN-encoding transgene is inducible, and this allows measurement of ZFN activity at different levels of the nuclease. C. DNA target sequences and recognition helices for the ZFNs used in the present work. The binding regions of left (ZFN-L) and right (ZFN-R) zinc finger protein array are underlined. Bases in capital letters are those that contribute to binding of the ZFP arrays. D. Summary of rabbit IgM mutant alleles obtained and characterized in offspring from ZFN microinjections. Stillborn animals are marked with an asterisk. The genotype of each allele is indicated to the right of the DNA sequence; inserted sequences are highlighted in red. </caption>
