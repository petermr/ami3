<p class="p">The kinetics of ZFN activity in fertilized oocytes should be as rapid as possible, preferably before the first cleavage, to ensure that ZFN induced mutations are included in the germ line. ZFN activity should also be transient, to avoid possible accumulation of additional mutations in the developing embryo. In pilot experiments we microinjected EGFP mRNA diluted in either EDTA solution (0.1 mM, pH 8), or Tris/EDTA buffer (5 mM/0.1 mM, pH 7.5) into one of the two pronuclei or the cytoplasm of fertilized rabbit oocytes. Microinjection was verified in each oocyte by observing slight swelling of the pronucleus, or disturbance in the cytoplasm caused by solution streaming from the capillary. Of the oocytes injected into the pronucleus, only those injected with Tris/EDTA survived and developed further. Following cytoplasmic injection, survival and development was better in embryos injected with EDTA. Cytoplasmic microinjection of mRNA diluted in EDTA also led to earlier onset and higher EGFP expression at lower concentrations than pronuclear microinjection of mRNA in Tris/EDTA (
