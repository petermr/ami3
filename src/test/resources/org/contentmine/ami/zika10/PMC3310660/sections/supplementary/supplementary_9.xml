   <bold>Southern analysis of fetuses.</bold> Samples of genomic DNA from 9 of the 17 fetuses recovered (numbers indicated) were digested with 
   <italic>BspHI</italic> and 
   <italic>HinDIII</italic> and hybridized to a probe comprising IgM exon 3, intron 3 and exon 4. Arrows indicate positions of the diagnostic 5.911 kb 
   <italic>HindIII-HindIII</italic> fragment, derived from the wild type allele, and the 3.943 kb 
   <italic>HindIII-BspHI</italic> fragment, derived from the targeted allele.
