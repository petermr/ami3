<p>We then tested if ZFN-mediated targeted sequence replacement was feasible directly in the oocyte. A gene targeting vector, IgME1, was designed to replace IgM exon 1 with a PGK neo cassette, providing âˆ¼1.9 kb of novel sequence. The strategy is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g003">Figure 3</xref>; the full sequence of the gene-targeting vector is shown in
