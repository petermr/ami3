<p>Mixtures of 
 <italic>MluI</italic> linearised IgME1 DNA (concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 ng/µl) and ZFN 18255/18257 mRNAs (concentrations ranging from 3 to 9 ng/µl of each) were injected into pronuclear stage fertilized oocytes, see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t003">Table 3</xref>. Since ZFN mRNAs are most effective when injected into the cytoplasm, but IgME1 targeting vector DNA must be located in the nucleus to serve as the donor during homology-directed repair, we employed a two-step microinjection procedure similar to that described by Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Meyer1">[23]</xref>. A portion of the mRNA/DNA mixture was first injected into a pronucleus to locate the vector DNA with the nuclear DNA. Then, on removing the injection needle, a second dose was injected into the cytoplasm to enable translation of ZFN mRNA. Microinjected oocytes were cultured to blastocyst stage and a total of 242 blastocysts were analyzed by PCR for targeted gene replacement events. Correct gene editing was detected in three blastocysts, as judged by the presence of a diagnostic 1.758 kb PCR product spanning the 5′ junction of the target site, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Data summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t003">Table 3</xref> show that concentrations of ZFN mRNA slightly higher than those used for mutagenesis were most effective in driving targeted sequence replacement. Combined data for all mRNA and targeting vector DNA concentrations indicated an overall rate of 1.2% targeted sequence replacement, but efficiency at the most effective mRNA/DNA concentrations was higher (17% at 9 ng/µl ZFN mRNA plus 10–15 ng/µl IgME1 DNA). Positive blastocysts were also screened for the presence of an intact IgM exon 1 by PCR. All gave a positive result, indicating that targeting had occurred at just one IgM allele.
