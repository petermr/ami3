 Introduction Rabbits are important laboratory animals, widely used in many areas of biomedical research, including the production of antibodies and recombinant proteins. Rabbit models have contributed to the understanding of human diseases and the development of therapeutic compounds, devices and techniques. However it has not been possible to engineer precise genetic alterations in rabbits because they have so far been refractory to the two key enabling technologies; (I) rabbit embryonic stem (ES) cells capable of contributing to the germ line have yet to be derived, and (II) rabbits are particularly difficult to produce by somatic cell nuclear transfer [1] . The power and facility of gene targeting in ES cells has made the mouse by far the most intensively studied mammal [2] . Extending gene targeting to other species would deepen our understanding of gene function and further the development of many valuable biomedical applications, but the lack of fully functional ES cells has been a long-standing obstacle. Nuclear transfer from cultured somatic cells (SCNT) was developed to circumvent the requirement for ES cells to generate gene-targeted animals. This is, however, technically difficult, and more than ten years since our first demonstration of targeting COL1A1 in sheep [3] , there are still few other examples: PRNP in sheep, cattle and goats [4] – [6] , GGTA1 in pigs [7] , [8] , IGH in cattle and pigs [5] , [9] , [10] , IGKC in pigs [11] and CFTR in pigs [12] . Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are new tools that promise to radically simplify gene knockout and targeted gene replacement. An appropriately designed ZFN can create a double-strand break at a single predetermined site in the genomic DNA of an organism. In eukaryotes, double-strand break repair pathways often create small insertions and deletions at the break site, a useful means of inactivating genes of interest (for review, see Urnov et al. [13] ). ZFN cleavage can also stimulate homology-directed genetic exchange between an episomal donor construct and a chromosomal locus, as first demonstrated for a native locus in Drosophila [14] and for endogenous loci in human cells [15] – [17] . A particularly promising approach is ZFN-mediated gene knockout directly in early embryos, because it offers a one-step method without any cell intermediate, as shown for zebrafish [18] , [19] , rats [20] , [21] and mice [22] . Most recently, ZFN-mediated gene targeting by homologous recombination has been achieved in mice and rats [23] , [24] . However ZFNs are likely to make their greatest impact in species where classical means of gene targeting are not available. Here we demonstrate that ZFNs enable precise genetic engineering in a particularly intractable species.
