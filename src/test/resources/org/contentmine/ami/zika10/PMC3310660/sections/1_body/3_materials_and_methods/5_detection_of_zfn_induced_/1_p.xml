<p>DNA was prepared from blastocysts by lysis in 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% Tween20 and 100 µg proteinase K; or by lysis in 8 µl 50 mM NaOH (10 min 95°C; 2 µl 1 M Tris, pH 7.5 then added for neutralization); and from fetal tissue or ear biopsies of offspring by standard methods. Rabbit Cµ was amplified by PCR using primer pairs E1.1f (
 <named-content content-type="gene">TGG CAG GGA CAC AGG AAA ACA</named-content>) and E1.1r (
 <named-content content-type="gene">GGC TCA CCG GGA AAG GAC</named-content>); or E1.2f (
 <named-content content-type="gene">GGC TGC CTG GCG CGG GAC TTT CT</named-content>) and E1.2r (
 <named-content content-type="gene">CTG TTG CTG TTG CTG TGC TGG ACT TTG</named-content>) for exon1 and E2.1f (
 <named-content content-type="gene">GGC TGC CTG GCG CGG GAC TTT C</named-content>) and E2.1r (
 <named-content content-type="gene">CCT GGC CTG GGG ACT GGA CAC TCA CT</named-content>) or E2.2f (
 <named-content content-type="gene">TGC CAG GCC ACA GGT TTC</named-content>) and E2.2r (
 <named-content content-type="gene">CTC GGA GGA CAT GGA CAC GTT CTT ATC</named-content>) for exon 2. Nested PCRs from blastocysts were performed using the two primer pairs specific for exon 1 or 2 consecutively. PCR products containing mutated sequences detected by DNA sequence chromatography were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) for DNA sequencing of ZFN-induced mutations.
