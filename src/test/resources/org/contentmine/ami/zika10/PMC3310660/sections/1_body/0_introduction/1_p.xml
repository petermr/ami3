<p>Rabbits are important laboratory animals, widely used in many areas of biomedical research, including the production of antibodies and recombinant proteins. Rabbit models have contributed to the understanding of human diseases and the development of therapeutic compounds, devices and techniques. However it has not been possible to engineer precise genetic alterations in rabbits because they have so far been refractory to the two key enabling technologies; (I) rabbit embryonic stem (ES) cells capable of contributing to the germ line have yet to be derived, and (II) rabbits are particularly difficult to produce by somatic cell nuclear transfer
