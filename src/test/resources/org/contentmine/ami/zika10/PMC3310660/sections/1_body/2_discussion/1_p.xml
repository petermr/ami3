<p class="p">Gene targeting in ES cells has propelled the mouse to the forefront of biomedical research. This is despite the fact that its small size limits the scope for many physiological investigations and the low blood volume precludes its use as a source of serum factors. Metabolic and physiological differences also limit the relevance of mice to some human diseases, e.g. cardiomyopathy

Other mammals, notably rabbit and pig, are increasingly seen as valuable alternatives but there is a significant need for efficient methods of precise genetic engineering in these species. Here we describe a generally applicable protocol for targeted genome editing in the rabbit. ZFNs introduced into fertilized oocytes can mediate gene inactivation by DNA repair mutagenesis and also homology-directed targeted sequence replacement. The technique is a simple, efficient and practical means of establishing lines of precisely genetically engineered rabbits.
