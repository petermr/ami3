 <caption> DNA sequence of IgME-1 targeted locus. The sequence of the IgME1 gene targeting vector is indicated by highlights; the 5′ and 3′ homologous arms in yellow and the PGK neo cassette in blue. The positions of primers used to amplify PCR fragments across the 5′ junction (targF4 and targR4) and across the 3′ junction (targF2 and targR2) are indicated. ApaI and MscI restriction sites used to confirm the identity of the 5′ PCR product (shown in Figure 3) and the BspHI site used for Southern analysis ( Figure S3) are indicated. (TIF) </caption>
