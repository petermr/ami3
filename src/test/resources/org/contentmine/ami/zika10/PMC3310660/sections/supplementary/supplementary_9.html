 <caption> Southern analysis of fetuses. Samples of genomic DNA from 9 of the 17 fetuses recovered (numbers indicated) were digested with BspHI and HinDIII and hybridized to a probe comprising IgM exon 3, intron 3 and exon 4. Arrows indicate positions of the diagnostic 5.911 kb HindIII-HindIII fragment, derived from the wild type allele, and the 3.943 kb HindIII-BspHI fragment, derived from the targeted allele.
