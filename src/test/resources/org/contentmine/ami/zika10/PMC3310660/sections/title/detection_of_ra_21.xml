 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Serum antibody concentrations from animals between 7 and 15 weeks of age were determined by ELISA on streptavidin pre-coated 96 well microtiter plates (Micro Coat Biotechnologie, Germany). Capture was by anti-rabbit-IgM (μ-chain) or anti-rabbit-IgG (Fc) biotin (624085 and 550326, BD Pharmingen); detection used mouse anti-rabbit IgM or IgG horseradish peroxidase (BD Pharmingen).</p>
