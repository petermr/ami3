<p>mRNA coding for ZFN pair 18255/18257 targeted to IgM exon 1 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g001">Figure 1</xref>) was injected into 267 oocytes, 208 embryos were transferred into recipients and 17 live offspring were born. mRNA coding for ZFN pair 18276/18277 targeted to IgM exon 2 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g001">Figure 1</xref>) was injected into 259 oocytes, 212 embryos were transferred into recipients, and 17 live offspring were also born. Sequence analysis of the IgM locus in these 34 rabbits revealed that six animals carried mutations in exon 1, and four had mutations in exon 2. Eighteen stillborn rabbits were also analyzed. Mutations at the IgM locus were detected in six animals (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t001">Table 1</xref>), a similar proportion as observed in the live offspring. DNA sequence analysis of live and stillborn rabbits revealed a variety of mutations at the IgM locus, including deletions of 1 to 25 bp, single base insertions, and combinations of small deletions and insertions. Results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g001">Figure 1D</xref>. Two live and one stillborn animal were found to carry two independent mutations at the IgM locus, suggesting that these were compound heterozygotes.
