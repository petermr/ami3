<p>Antioxidants inhibit the production of malondialdehyde and, therefore, the color produced after addition of 2-thiobarbituric acid is less intense. None of the compounds interfered with the assay, neither with the conjugation of 2-thiobarbituric acid or with the absorption at 535â€“600 nm. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. The UV measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 554 spectrophotometer.</p>
