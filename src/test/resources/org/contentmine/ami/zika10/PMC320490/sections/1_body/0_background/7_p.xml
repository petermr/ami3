<p>In a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] we have shown that 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-N,N,-di-n-propyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-benz [g]indole-7-amine (
 <bold>PBIA</bold>) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) acts 
 <italic>in vivo </italic>as a functional dopamine receptor partial agonist. It is known that a partial agonist at any dose level can not produce the same maximal biological response as a full agonist even though the partial agonist binds as tightly and as well to the receptor as the full agonist. In sum, a partial agonist has high affinity for its receptor, but low intrinsic activity. 
 <bold>PBIA </bold>is a moderate [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-spiperone and 8-OH-[
 <sup>3</sup>H]-DPAT competitor. Spiperone is a selective D
 <sub>2 </sub>antagonist while 8-OH-DPAT is a selective 5-HT
 <sub>1A </sub>agonist. This means that 
 <bold>PBIA </bold>expresses a moderate binding affinity at the dopamine D
 <sub>2 </sub>and serotonin 5-HT
 <sub>1A </sub>receptors in 
 <italic>in vitro </italic>competition binding assays.
