<p class="p">An alternate, though highly speculative hypothesis, is the proposal that TD is due to neurotoxic effects induced by free radical byproducts from catecholamine metabolism. The basal ganglia, by virtue of their high oxidative metabolism, are vulnerable to membrane lipid peroxidation as a result of the increased catecholamine turnover induced by neuroleptic drugs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" class="xref">9</xref>]. It is known that vitamin E (a-tocopherol) serves as a free radical scavenger, thus reducing the cytotoxic effects of free radicals. Clinical studies have produced conflicting data in this area. The impression gained from these studies was that while vitamin E is safe and well-tolerated, it confers only modest benefits. Some studies do not support the hypothesis that TD is mediated through free radical damage to neurons [
