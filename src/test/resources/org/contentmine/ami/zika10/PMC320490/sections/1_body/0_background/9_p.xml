 <bold class="bold">TPBIA </bold>has an increased lipophilicity and an appropriate polar molecular surface area (PSA) value, we hypothesized that it might be capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier in a considerable degree. Additionally, the presence of the tosyl group might shift the agonistic activity to that of an antagonist. It is documented that increasing the van der Waals molecular volume of an agonist makes it an antagonist [
