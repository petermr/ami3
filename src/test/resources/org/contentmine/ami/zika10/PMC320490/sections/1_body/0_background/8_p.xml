 <bold>PBIA </bold>was designed as a metabolically stable bioisostere of the potent dopamine receptor agonist 5-OH-DPAT, (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Phenolic dopamine receptor agonists suffer from poor bioavailability due to rapid metabolic inactivation via conjugation. Thus, an approach which has been pursued to overcome this problem is to develop non phenolic heterocyclic analogues. In this respect, evidence indicates that an indole NH moiety can be a bioisostere of the hydrogen-bonding H donor properties of the phenolic OH group in dopamine agonists. Based on the above, we synthesized 
 <bold>PBIA</bold>.
