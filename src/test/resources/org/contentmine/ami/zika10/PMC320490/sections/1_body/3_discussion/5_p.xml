 <bold>a) </bold>The Polar Surface Area (PSA) of a molecule is defined as the area of its van der Waals surface that arises from oxygen and nitrogen atoms as well as hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen or nitrogen atoms. As such, it is clearly related to the capacity of a compound to form hydrogen bonds. PSA has been established as a valuable physicochemical parameter for the prediction of a number of properties related to the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs. Among these properties are the intestinal absorption and the blood-brain barrier penetration. PSA has been found to be useful in modeling intestinal absorption together with a direct estimate of lipophilicity widely acknowledged as an important factor in transport across membranes. A common measure of the degree of BBB penetration is the ratio of the steady-state concentrations of the drug molecule in the brain and in the blood, usually expressed as log(Cbrain/Cblood). We expect that the increased lipophilicity (calculated [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], 38.9 Angstroems
 <sup>2</sup>) of this compound will facilitate its central nervous system penetration. Thus by using an equation reported by Clark et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] we found that the steady-state distribution of 
 <bold>TPBIA </bold>between brain and blood is approximately 1000/1 (logBB = 0.58). This computational model contains two variables: PSA and calculated logP, both of which can be rapidly computed. The model could be considered reliable; for example the measured and predicted BBB permeability of the antidepressant drug, amitryptyline were quite similar (experimental logBB = 0.76â€“0.98 and calculated logBB = 0.76). Finally, its low PSA value is a strong indication that it could be used
