<p class="p">Third, the complexity of vector transmission offers the pathogen increased opportunities to evolve. In almost no instances is the arthropod simply a vessel for transmission. Usually, the pathogen must move from the gut to the feeding apparatus to be transmitted. Mechanisms range from the relatively simple, as with the plague bacillus, 
 <italic class="italic">Yersinia pestis</italic>, to the elaborately intricate, as with parasites in the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic>. In these examples, the pathogen replicates in some fashion, which makes it dependent on an invertebrate host physiology much different from what it will encounter in its various vertebrate hosts. As a consequence, epidemic emergence can result from enhanced transmission independent of increased pathogenicity to humans. This is especially true of the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that infect humans, all of which are RNA viruses and have high potential mutability. A notable recent example is the chikungunya virus epidemic that swept through the Indian Ocean region beginning in 2006 and which is believed to have infected &gt;2 million persons. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the virus genome accelerated its replication in the relatively common mosquito 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic>, usually a poorer host than 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (

  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>). There is also evidence that an SNP enabled Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to jump vectors, sparking the 1993 epidemic in Mexico (

  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>), and it might have been an SNP in West Nile virus that increased its virulence to birds and influenced the shape of the epidemic in the United States (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). In none of these examples was increased pathogenicity to humans an apparent seminal factor in the epidemics.
