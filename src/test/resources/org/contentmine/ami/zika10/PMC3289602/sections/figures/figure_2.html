 <caption> Zika virus phylogeny. Nucleotide (top) and amino acid (bottom) sequences of the envelope protein/gene of Zika virus strains showing the deletions in the potential glycosylation sites of the MR 766 (Uganda, 1947) and the IbH 30656 (Nigeria, 1968) strains. Deletions are indicated by dashes. The “N” at position 467 of the P6-740 strain (Malaysia, 1966) represents an equally weighted double population of the nucleotides “C” and “T”. This translates to an “X” at position 165 of the amino acid alignment. </caption>
