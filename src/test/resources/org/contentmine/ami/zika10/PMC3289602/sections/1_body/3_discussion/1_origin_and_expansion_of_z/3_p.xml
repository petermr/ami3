<p>Our results strengthen previous epidemiologic evidence that the EC Yap strain originated in Southeast Asia

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Lanciotti1">[17]</xref>. This conclusion is further substantiated by the geographic proximity of Yap Island to known areas of ZIKV transmission (Indonesia and Malaysia). It has been reported that wind-blown mosquitoes can travel distances of several hundred kilometers over the open ocean

However, due to the great distances involved, it seems likely that the virus was introduced as a result of travel or trade activities whereby either a viremic person, enzootic host species, and/or an infected and subsequently infective mosquito (adult or immature) was transported to the island as suggested by Duffey
