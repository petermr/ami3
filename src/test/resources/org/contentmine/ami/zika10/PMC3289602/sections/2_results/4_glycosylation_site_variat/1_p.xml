<p>Deletions in a potential glycosylation site of several strains were observed following their alignment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001477-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A 4-codon deletion was observed beginning at amino acid position 153 of the E protein of the MR766 strain (GenBank accession number AY632535), a 6-codon deletion at position 156 of another MR 766 strain (GenBank accession number DQ859059), and a 6-codon deletion at position 156 of the IbH 30656 strain sequenced in this study. The MR 766 strain (Passage 147) sequenced here did not exhibit any deletions in the predicted amino acid sequence and provided evidence of passage-associated changes in potential glycosylation site(s).
