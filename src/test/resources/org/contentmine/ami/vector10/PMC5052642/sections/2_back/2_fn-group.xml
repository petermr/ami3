   <bold>Author contributions</bold> The cell housing for electrochemical 
   <italic>operando</italic> experiments was designed and tested by J.E. and P.P.; P.P. prepared the samples and acquired the data at the TOMCAT beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Switzerland) together with F.M. P.P. performed the DVC, strain and dynamic microstructure analysis. P.P., D.W. and J.F. performed the analysis on the graphite binarized data set. P.P. performed the analysis of the SiC electrode presented in Fig. 5. All authors contributed to discussions. V.W., V.S. and M.S. supervised the project and helped with writing the publication.
