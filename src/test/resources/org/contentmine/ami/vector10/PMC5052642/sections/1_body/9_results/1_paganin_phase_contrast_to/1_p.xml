 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> schematically depicts the measurement setup. We construct an electrochemical cell for 
 <italic>operando</italic> XTM, consisting of a polyether ether ketone cell housing tube and two steel current collectors. The system we investigate here consists of two, 250 μm-thick electrodes of platelet-shaped graphite particles spaced with a 250 μm-thick glass fibre separator. To capture both lithiation and delithiation dynamics simultaneously, the top electrode is fully lithiated before the experiment in a standard coin cell in half-cell configuration using a metallic lithium counter electrode. The incident 25 keV monochromatic X-rays penetrate the cell in transmission geometry and are converted to visible light using a scintillator such that the image can be magnified with an optical microscope and recorded by a sCMOS camera.
