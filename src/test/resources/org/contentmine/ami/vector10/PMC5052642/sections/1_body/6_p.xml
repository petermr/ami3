<p>Second, we therefore enrich the image contrast obtained with standard attenuation-based XTM measurements by making use of emerging X-ray phase contrast techniques. Coherent X-rays produced by synchrotrons probe the complex refractive index

 <italic>δ</italic>)+
 <italic>iβ</italic> of a sample. While attenuation contrast tomography maps the imaginary part of the refractive index (
 <italic>β</italic>, representing beam attenuation), phase contrast tomography maps the real part of the refractive index (
 <italic>δ</italic>, representing beam deflection). Phase contrast tomography often requires more complicated measurement setups and is typically more prone to different types of artefacts than attenuation contrast tomography. However, it enhances the contrast between different weakly attenuating materials.
