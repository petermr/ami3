<p>To investigate the mechanical deformation and electrochemical activity occurring in a SiC electrode during lithiation, as well as the influence of the two types of particle expansion on the microstructure and subsequent electrode performance, we repeat the experiment described above on an electrode containing the same graphite particles mixed with micron-sized silicon particles in a weight ratio of 3:1. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> shows a rendering of a part of the electrode in the pristine state, where the more attenuating silicon particles are depicted in yellow and the less attenuating graphite particles are depicted in red.
