 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5d</xref> quantifies the expansion of the SiC electrode using (i) the 3D spatial average of the cumulated divergence within the electrode and (ii) the electrode thickness as determined directly from the tomographic scans (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). The mean correlation values of all DVC computations exceed 90% and the results from the two methods are in excellent agreement with each other. The results indicate that the SiC electrode expansion occurs linearly as a function of the SOC. This is in contrast to graphite, where both the electrode volume and particle volume are nonlinear functions of the SOC (compare ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Linear expansion as a function of SOC is characteristic for silicon (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). This observation suggests that the electrodes inherit their expansion characteristics from the expansion properties of the constituent particles, and that the expansion of the SiC electrode is dominated by the expansion of silicon.
