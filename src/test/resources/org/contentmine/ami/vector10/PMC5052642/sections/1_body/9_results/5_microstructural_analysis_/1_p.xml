<p>Next we demonstrate that our imaging and analysis approach can be used to determine whether the mechanical deformation of the porous electrodes during the (de)lithiation process impacts the transport of lithium ions in the electrode. Here, we focus our analysis on the lithiating bottom electrode.</p>
