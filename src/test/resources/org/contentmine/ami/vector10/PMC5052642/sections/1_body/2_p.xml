<p>Because its low core charge number (Z=3) makes lithium highly transparent to X-rays, XTM experiments that map the lithium content in battery materials during (de)lithiation typically track: (i) the volumetric change, (ii) the attenuation coefficient change or (iii) the absorption edge shifts of the active material. Approaches (i) and (ii) can be performed with X-rays at a single energy and rely on the change in the number density of active material atoms (volume is inversely proportional to density and the X-ray attenuation coefficient is proportional to density). Approach (iii) is based on absorption spectroscopy and relies on the change of oxidation state of one or more species of host atoms. Analysing the lithium distribution in an electrode with any of these three techniques requires that the active material be distinguishable from other solid phases and from the pore space within the electrodes.</p>
