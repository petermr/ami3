 <caption> Measurement setup and parameter selection. ( a) Sketch of the electrochemical cell and the measurement setup, including a coordinate system indicating the two IP directions and the TP direction. ( b) Comparison of a slice in the bottom electrode, where the phase has been retrieved with different δ/ β ratios. Insets show the respective colour-scale histograms. Scale bar length: 100 μm. ( c) Microstructure rendering of a part of the bottom electrode using the retrieval parameters from the two extreme cases in ( b). Scale bar length: 100 μm. ( d) Specific charge, voltage and scanning times during operando electrochemical operation. The inset shows a zoom-in of the voltage profile arising from the applied galvanostatic intermittent titration technique protocol. ( e) Vertical cuts through the sample at different states of charge. The blue lines mark the electrode–separator interfaces that shift on electrochemical operation. For better visibility, only a window around the separator is shown. Scale bar length: 50 μm. </caption>
