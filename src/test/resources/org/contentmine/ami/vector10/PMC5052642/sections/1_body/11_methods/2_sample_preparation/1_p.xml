<p>For the pure graphite electrodes, slurries were prepared by mixing 3.6 g commercial graphite platelets (Imerys, TIMREX SLP50), 5.333 g 6 wt% PVDF binder (Kynar Flex HSV900) premixed in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and 0.08 g Carbon Black (Imerys, C65) in 2 g NMP in a high shear mixer for 10 min (weight ratio 90/8/2 wt%). The slurries were sonicated for 5 min and put on a roll bar for 2 h to remove the remaining air bubbles. Thick electrodes of 250 μm were fabricated by coating a copper foil with the slurry and drying in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 8 h.</p>
