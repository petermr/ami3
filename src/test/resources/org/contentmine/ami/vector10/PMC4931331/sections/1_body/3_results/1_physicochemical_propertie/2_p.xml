<p>On the other hand, the drawbacks of the high volatility and high flammability of linear carbonate solvents can be overcome to a large degree owing to the much lower content of organic solvents in the concentrated solutions. Thermogravimetry measurements (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) show that the weight loss of the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC solution is only 1.5 wt% after elevating the temperature to 100 °C, which is considerably lower than those of a dilute 1:10.8 LiFSA/DMC solution (65.5 wt%, corresponding to 1.0 mol dm
 <sup>−3</sup>) and a commercial electrolyte (28.7 wt%). As demonstrated in the flame tests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>), the 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC solution does not burn as fiercely as the commercial dilute electrolyte. The superior thermal stability and flame retardant ability of the concentrated electrolytes contribute to the remarkably improved safety properties as compared with the dilute electrolytes.
