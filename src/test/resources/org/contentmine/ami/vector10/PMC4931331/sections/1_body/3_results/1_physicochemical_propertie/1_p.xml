<p>LiFSA salt was dissolved at various concentrations into three different carbonate ester solvents: dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC) and mixed EC:DMC. All the mixtures are transparent liquids at room temperature (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> as an example). Their basic physicochemical properties are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> shows their viscosity as a function of salt concentration. Independent of the solvents used, the viscosity increases exponentially with increasing the LiFSA mole fraction (

 <sub>LiFSA</sub>). Among the three groups of solutions, the group with DMC as the solvent shows the lowest viscosity because pure DMC has a lower viscosity than pure EC or mixed EC:DMC. For electrolytes with similar solvation radiuses of mobile ions, the ionic conductivity is proportional to the number of mobile ions and inversely proportional to the viscosity of the medium

 <sub>LiFSA</sub>&lt;0.14 (below 1.5 mol dm
 <sup>−3</sup>), the use of the EC:DMC mixture shows the highest ionic conductivity owing to a synergistic effect: the high-dielectric-constant EC increases the mobile ion number by promoting salt dissociation; the low-viscosity DMC increases the ion mobility by decreasing the solution viscosity. This is why the mixed solvents of EC and linear carbonates are generally adopted in conventional electrolytes of the lithium-ion battery
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, when

 <sub>LiFSA</sub> is above 0.14, the solution with DMC as the sole solvent shows an even higher ionic conductivity than that with EC:DMC, which should result from the much lower viscosity of the former at high concentrations. This result suggests that the viscosity becomes the decisive factor on the ionic conductivity for a concentrated solution, wherein intensive ionic association exists independent of the solvents used, showing a distinct departure from the conventional electrolyte design strategy on the basis of dilute concentrations. For the LiFSA/DMC solution, a commercially acceptable ionic conductivity of 1.12 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (30 °C) is obtained even at a ‘super-high' concentration with salt-to-solvent molar ratio of 1:1.1 despite a high viscosity of 238.9 mPa s. Although the ionic conductivity is lower than that of the commercial dilute electrolyte, it does not compromise the rate capability of the battery (shown later).
