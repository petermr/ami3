  <title>Oxidation stability of an aluminium electrode.</title>
  <p>LSV of an aluminium electrode in various concentrations of LiFSA/DMC electrolytes in a three-electrode cell. The scan rate was 1.0 mV s
   <sup>−1</sup>. The insets are scanning electron microscopy images of the Al surface polarized in the dilute 1:10.8 (left of panel) and superconcentrated 1:1.1 (right of panel) electrolytes. Many corroding pits cover the surface of the Al electrode polarized in the dilute electrolyte, showing a severe anodic Al dissolution. In contrast, no corroding pits appear on the surface of the Al electrode polarized in the superconcentrated electrolyte, indicating a good inhibition of anodic Al dissolution. The white scale bar represents 20 μm.
