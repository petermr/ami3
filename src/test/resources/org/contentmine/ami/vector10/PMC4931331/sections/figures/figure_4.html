 <caption> Li salt−solvent coordination structure dependent on salt concentration. ( a) The several main species in the LiFSA/DMC solutions. ( b) Raman spectra of LiFSA/DMC solutions with various salt-to-solvent molar ratios in the range of 890–900 cm −1 (O-CH 3 stretching mode of the DMC solvent) and 700–780 cm −1 (S-N stretching mode of the FSA − anion). Snapshots of typical equilibrium trajectories obtained by DFT-MD simulations: ( c) dilute solution (1 LiFSA/25 DMC, &lt;1 mol dm −3), ( d) moderately concentrated solution (12 LiFSA/24 DMC, ca. 4 mol dm −3), and ( e) superconcentrated solution (10 LiFSA/11 DMC, ca. 5.5 mol dm −3). The coordination of Li +−DMC and Li +−FSA − is supposed to build up when the involved atoms locate within 2.5 Å from Li +. The coordination numbers of solvents and anions to Li + are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. Li cations are marked in purple. Free and coordinated DMC molecules are marked in light blue and grey, respectively. Free, CIP and AGG states of FSA − anions are marked in red, orange and dark blue, respectively. Hydrogen atoms are not shown. </caption>
