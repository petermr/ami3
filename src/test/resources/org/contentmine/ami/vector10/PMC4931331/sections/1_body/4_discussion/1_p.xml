<p>The conventional dilute LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/EC-based electrolytes have dominated the electrolyte market of 4 V-class lithium-ion batteries over the past 25 years; however, they show difficulties in satisfying the requirements of next-generation 5 V-class batteries in terms of both safety and stability. Our work demonstrates a number of electrolytes with a reinforced three-dimensional network that are obtained by simple mixing of a stable salt with a conventional carbonate solvent at ‘super-high' concentrations. Owing to its peculiar structural characteristics, the superconcentrated electrolytes overcomes the longstanding challenge faced by the unstable LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>-based electrolytes at high voltages (passivating the Al current collector versus accelerating the transition metal dissolution of the active material), thus, enables a stable operation of a 5 V-class battery. Emphasis is on the fact that the peculiar solution structure and functionalities are unique to such super-high concentrations (solvent/salt≈1.1), and cannot be achieved in moderately high concentrations (solvent/salt&gt;1.8) as in previous reports

Besides the positive electrode side, the superconcentrated electrolytes also show a good compatibility with the natural graphite-negative electrode even in the absence of EC. It breaks through the limitation of a general requirement of EC for a SEI formation for a lithium-ion electrolyte, and diversifies the electrolyte formulation towards various EC-free electrolytes. Different from the conventional electrolyte design that requires a high-dielectric-constant (usually high-viscosity) solvent, the superconcentrated electrolyte prefers a low-viscosity solvent. Although the ionic conductivity of the superconcentrated electrolyte is lower than that of the conventional dilute electrolyte, it does not necessarily compromise the rate capability of the battery. Clarification of the corresponding mechanism would be enlightening for developing novel high-power batteries. Furthermore, the superconcentrated electrolytes show superior thermal stability and flame retardant ability, alleviating the safety risk for a high-voltage battery using conventional dilute electrolytes. Finally, it is noteworthy that our reported superconcentrated electrolytes do not contain any additives, signifying the potential to further enhance the performance. These desirable features above outperform the conventional dilute electrolytes; meanwhile, the wide-temperature window of the liquid state (ensuring a good contact with the electrode materials), as well as the convenience of the approach, surpass the solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, the superconcentrated electrolytes might offer opportunities to build safe and stable high-voltage batteries that are not limited to the lithium-ion.
