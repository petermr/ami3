<p>In contrast with layered-LNMO specimens, STEM–EDS mapping of spinel-LNMO indicates a uniform distribution of Mn, Ni and O, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–d</xref>. A mass-to-charge spectra from APT analysis of spinel-LNMO, provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, indicates a distribution of elemental and molecular ions similar to the as-fabricated layered-LNMO. Elemental ions of Li, Mn, Ni and O correspond to 74.23% of the ions detected; 24.2% of the ions detected correspond to O
 <sub>2</sub>, MnO, NiO, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MnO
 <sub>3</sub> combined, and the remaining 1.58% includes all other complex molecular ions. APT reconstructions of the spinel-LNMO indicated uniform distributions of Li, Ni, Mn and O, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e–g</xref>, in agreement with the STEM–EDS results for Ni, Mn and O. The APT-measured composition of spinel-LNMO was 20.06±0.03 at % Li, 9.59±0.02 at % Ni, 27.28±0.03 at % Mn and 43.06±0.04 at % O. The expected composition of these spinel-LNMO specimens is 14.29 at % Li, 7.14 at % Ni, 21.43 at % Mn and 57.14 at % O. As it is expected that oxygen will be underestimated with the 20-pJ laser energy, it is more sensible to renormalize the Li, Ni and Mn ratios excluding oxygen, for example, as 
 <italic>M</italic>/(Li+Mn+Ni). Cation ratios estimated in this manner were 0.35 for Li, 0.48 for Mn, and 0.17 for Ni. The expected cation ratios for stoichiometric LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> are 0.33 for Li, 0.5 for Mn, and 0.17 for Ni, in excellent agreement with APT results, reinforcing the accuracy of APT in measuring Li, Ni and Mn in these samples.
