<p>In summary, by comparing the as-fabricated and cycled layered-LNMO we have demonstrated a cycling-induced increased segregation of Li, Mn and O. The APT results of cycled layered-LNMO represent one of the first instances of direct evidence for Li loss in cycled cathode materials, consistent with previous TEM studies and typical explanations for irreversible capacity loss upon cycling of layered cathode materials. Comparison with compositionally uniform spinel-LNMO unambiguously establishes that the laser-assisted APT can differentiate Li segregation in battery-relevant materials at sub-nanometre-scale, in 3D. We anticipate significant application of APT analysis for understanding elemental distribution not just in the as-fabricated cathode materials, but also in electrochemically cycled materials to obtain important insight towards understanding capacity degradation in the cathode materials as a function of extent of cycling.</p>
