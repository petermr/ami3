 <caption> Comparison of TEM EDS tomography with APT results of layered-LNMO. ( a) STEM image and EDS maps of ( b) Ni (green) ( c) Mn (blue) ( d) Ni and Mn composite map ( e) O (red). Two element composite maps of the APT reconstructions are shown from f to h where each dot correspond to an atom in the reconstruction. ( f) Mn (blue) and Ni (green) ion distribution ( g) Li (yellow) and Ni (green) ion distribution and ( h) O (red) and Mn (blue) ion distribution. ( i) 13 at % Ni isocomposition surface highlighting the Ni-rich regions in the reconstruction ( j) Proximity histogram 51 obtained across the 13 at% Ni isocomposition surface showing concentration partitioning between Ni-rich and Mn-rich regions. </caption>
