<p>A reduction in Li concentration and increase in the Mn and Ni concentration is observed in the cycled layered-LNMO specimens, in agreement with previous literature postulating a loss of Li as a function of cycling

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Two-dimensional composition plots of Li, Ni, Mn and O, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d–g</xref>, show that Li, Ni and Mn partially segregate. A proximity histogram plotted across a Ni 14 at% isocomposition surface, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, illustrates the interface between the Ni-rich and Ni-depleted regions within the reconstruction. The proxygram highlights that Li is depleted where Ni is enriched, and that Mn is enriched at the interface between Ni- and Li-rich regions. A second proximity histogram across a Li-rich region indicates a very high Li concentration reaching nearly 100 at %. This apparently facetted region may correspond to a void formed inside the cathode nanoparticle during cycling, with an accumulation of Li. Comparison of the frequency histograms for Li, Mn, Ni and O in the cycled and as-fabricated layered-LNMO indicates an increased phase separation of Li, Mn and O (as indicated by the higher Pearson coefficient for Li, Mn and O of 0.970, 0.915, 0.76, respectively, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e–h</xref>). The Pearson coefficient of Ni was observed to be 0.555, indicating Ni enrichment near the surface of cycled cathode materials. It is to be noted that recent STEM imaging and EDS measurements observed similar Ni enrichment in as-fabricated and cycled layered-LNMO particles . However, the pre-existing Ni-rich regions in the as-fabricated specimens were not captured within the APT reconstructions from the four cycled layered-LNMO particles. Pearson coefficient of molecular species of NiO (0.523), MnO (0.281), MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.259), MnO
 <sub>3</sub> (0.353), Ni
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.331), O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.218) and NiO
 <sub>3</sub> (0.165) were also above 0.1. Each elemental and molecular species with a &gt;0.1 Pearson coefficient values also showed a 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.001 at 95% confidence interval during null-hypothesis testing, establishing statistically significant segregation of these species in the cycled layered-LNMO.
