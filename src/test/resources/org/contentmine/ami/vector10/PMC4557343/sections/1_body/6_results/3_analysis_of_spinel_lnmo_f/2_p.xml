<p>Frequency distribution analysis of the APT results from spinel LNMO was conducted to quantify the uniformity of the distribution of each element. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5aâ€“d</xref> shows the observed frequency distributions of Li, Ni, Mn and O compared with a binomial distribution. It is clear that spinel-LNMO has a more uniform distribution compared to the as-fabricated layered-LNMO shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. The Pearson coefficients estimated from the 200 atom bin size frequency distribution analysis for Li, Ni, Mn and O were 0.109, 0.047, 0.073 and 0.106 respectively (shown as inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), all indicating a very close to uniform distribution. The Pearson coefficient estimated for all the molecular species were also well below 0.1. A Pearson coefficient value close to 0 is indicative of a uniform distribution of elements

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The 
 <italic>P</italic> values estimated at a 95% confidence interval for Li and O was observed to be below 0.001 and the 
 <italic>P</italic> value for Mn and Ni were 0.095 and 0.568. These 
 <italic>P</italic> values in combination with the Pearson coefficient values when compared with layered-LNMO results indicate that there is only a minor deviation from random distribution for Li and O, but Ni and Mn are distributed rather uniformly in the spinel-LNMO APT result.
