<p>To quantify the extent of phase separation, frequency distribution analysis was performed on the APT results. The entire APT data set was divided in-to 200-atom bins, the composition of each bin was calculated and a histogram was plotted. For a random solid solution, a binomial frequency distribution is expected. Any deviation from randomness will lead to a deviation from binomial distribution. The frequency distribution analysis of Li, Ni, Mn and O in layered-LNMO is shown in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The Pearson coefficients for elemental Li and Ni obtained from the 200-atom bin size frequency distribution analysis were 0.869 and 0.792, respectively; Mn and O had Pearson coefficient of 0.253 and 0.391, respectively. The NiO, MnO
 <sub>3</sub> and O
 <sub>2</sub> also had higher Pearson coefficient values of 0.535, 0.201 and 0.129, respectively, with all other molecular species below 0.1. Also all these elemental and molecular species with &gt;0.1 Pearson coefficients resulted in 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.001 at 95% confidence level during the null-hypothesis testing. These higher Pearson coefficient values and very low 
 <italic>P</italic> values reaffirm the existence of statistically significant extent of compositional segregation in as-fabricated layered-LNMO.
