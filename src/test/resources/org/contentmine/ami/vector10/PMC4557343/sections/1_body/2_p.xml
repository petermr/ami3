<p>Under battery chargeâ€“discharge cycling, layered Li
 <sub>1.2</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.2</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.6</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes were observed to develop a thin surface reconstruction layer, featuring structural transformation, Mn and Ni enrichment, oxygen vacancy formation and Li depletion

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Due to the structural and chemical change of the thin surface layer, it is believed to be a likely main contributor to voltage fading

 <sub>1.2</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.2</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.6</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has indicated composition variations even within the thin surface reconstruction layer
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To understand the structural degradation mechanism and seek a means to suppress the surface reconstruction, requires monitoring the evolution of all elements quantitatively at different states of cycling. However, despite substantial characterization efforts in previous studies, quantifying lithium depletion and subtle changes in oxygen concentration in the surface layer have been proven to be elusively challenging.
