 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Currently, there is also a strong interest in developing cost-effective, rapidly recharging Li-ion batteries suitable for long range electric vehicles
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. As cathodes constitute a substantial portion of the volume and cost of a battery significant effort has been focused on the development of next-generation cathode materials

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Designing materials that can retain structural integrity after repeated cycling is a substantial challenge
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Fast ionic transport during electrochemical cycling of a material depends critically on the initial structure and crystal stability. The presence and stability of channels for fast Li-ion diffusion in cathode materials is an important design criterion for developing next-generation cathode materials for Li-ion batteries with higher capacity and long-term energy storage performance. Understanding nanoscale distribution of all of the elements that makeup Li-ion battery cathodes—especially Li ions—as a function of different synthesis procedures and extents of electrochemical cycling is a critical step towards developing new materials.
