<p>On chargeâ€“discharge cycling of layered-LNMO cathodes with pre-existing Ni-rich regions, an additional Ni-rich surface reconstruction layer (SRL) has been found to form and grow as a function of cycling

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. By detailed STEM, EDS and EELS measurements, a compositional partitioning of Ni and Mn has been observed within the SRL. As the Li concentration is expected to vary between the SRL and bulk of the cathode nanoparticle as a function of cycling, layered-LNMO cathodes cycled for 45 cycles were examined by APT. Needle-shaped APT specimens were fabricated from four different cycled layered-LNMO particles and during the needle preparation the needle specimen apex was kept very close to the top surface of the particles. The overall composition for each of the APT results from the four cycled layered-LNMO particles and two as-fabricated layered-LNMO particles are given below in
