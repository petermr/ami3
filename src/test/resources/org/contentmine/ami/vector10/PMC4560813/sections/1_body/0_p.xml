<p>The importance of developing new types of energy conversion and storage systems is evident by the ever-increasing human reliance on energy-based appliances, the rapidly diminishing fossil fuels and the continuously growing environmental concerns. The global energy consumption by automobiles, along with the associated green-house-gas emission, has been accelerating at an alarming rate due to the rapid increase in world population and economic expansion worldwide. Unlike traditional vehicles relying heavily on the fossil fuels, electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles hold great promise to solve current energy and environmental challenges. With recent advance in the development of eco-friendly rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) of higher power and energy densities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) using LIB pack(s) for propulsion have attracted a great deal of interest
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Of particular interest, Tesla has recently demonstrated the use of a battery pack consisting of 7,000 cylindrical LIB cells (each with 18 mm in diameter × 65 mm in length) connected in series and parallel to power electric vehicles (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although the excellent electrochemical performance of LIBs, including their high specific capacity, power and energy density, and rate capability, could ensure a long cruise duration, short charging time and low total cost of a BEV, implementing the BEV technology in our daily life is still a big challenge as it requires a cross-country network of BEV-charging stations. This will not only cause inflexibilities to travel plans but also inevitably increase the total cost of the BEV technology. Therefore, the large-scale practical application of BEVs cannot be realized unless LIBs with self-charging suppliers will be achieved.
