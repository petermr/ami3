 <p>Electric vehicles using lithium-ion battery pack(s) for propulsion have recently attracted a great deal of interest. The large-scale practical application of battery electric vehicles may not be realized unless lithium-ion batteries with self-charging suppliers will be developed. Solar cells offer an attractive option for directly photo-charging lithium-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the use of perovskite solar cell packs with four single CH
  <sub>3</sub>NH
  <sub>3</sub>PbI
  <sub>3</sub> based solar cells connected in series for directly photo-charging lithium-ion batteries assembled with a LiFePO
  <sub>4</sub> cathode and a Li
  <sub>4</sub>Ti
  <sub>5</sub>O
  <sub>12</sub> anode. Our device shows a high overall photo-electric conversion and storage efficiency of 7.80% and excellent cycling stability, which outperforms other reported lithium-ion batteries, lithiumâ€“air batteries, flow batteries and super-capacitors integrated with a photo-charging component. The newly developed self-chargeable units based on integrated perovskite solar cells and lithium-ion batteries hold promise for various potential applications.
