 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c,d</xref>). The electrochemical performance of a LFPO–Li or LTO–Li half cell (lithium foil as a counter and reference electrode) and a full cell of LFPO–LTO (with a LFPO/LTO mass ratio of ∼1.1) was given in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> shows the rate capability of the LFPO and LTO electrodes with respect to a full LFPO–LTO cell at the same C-rates. As can be seen, the LFPO and LTO electrodes exhibited initial charge/discharge capacities of 159.1/152.5 and 152.8/158.6 mAh g

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d,e</xref> show typical charge–discharge profiles for the LFPO–Li and LTO–Li half cells, respectively, at various C-rates, showing the flat voltage profiles without significant over-potential at the C-rate ≤0.5 C. Similar flat discharge–charge profiles were observed for the LFPO–LTO cell. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,f</xref>, the LFPO–LTO cell exhibited a good cycling stability over a wide range of C-rates from 0.2 to 2 C with average charge/discharge capacities of 145.3/144.3 mAh g
