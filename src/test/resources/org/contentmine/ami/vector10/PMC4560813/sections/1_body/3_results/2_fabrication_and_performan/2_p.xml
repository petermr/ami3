<p>Before the system integration, we have further investigated the PSC performance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a,b</xref> show typical current density–voltage (

 <italic>V</italic>) characteristics for a single PSC and four of them connected in series, respectively. For the single PSC, a short-circuit photocurrent density of 22.85 mA cm

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5a and 6</xref>. As a result, we obtained a short-circuit photocurrent density of 4.82 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (per the total area of four PSCs), open-circuit voltage of 3.84 V, fill factor of 0.68 and PCE of 12.65% for the connected PSC unit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). While the connected PSC unit exhibited sufficiently good performance with a high open-circuit voltage (3.84 V) for photo-charging LIBs, its long-term operation stability was tested, along with the corresponding single cells, to be superb even up to 720 h (in Ar atmosphere).
