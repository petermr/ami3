<p>In the mica–graphene experiment, increasing the force by increments of ∼5 mN (3.1 bar) results in further stepwise thinning of the confined film thickness, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>. This behaviour can be interpreted as further removal of mobile layers of the electrolyte molecules. The thickness of the interface film is ∼8 nm. However, after a short stabilization period, a further increase in contact pressure can then apparently push out more electrolyte. This indicates an increased mobility of battery electrolytes over graphene surfaces. Here the lowest value of ∼3.6 nm of the total layer thickness can be reached. Assuming a perfect symmetry in the 5.1-nm-thick nano-layer between the two (symmetrical) mica surfaces suggests the thickness of the rigid film on mica to be ∼2.5 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and hence the rigid-film thicknesses on gold and graphene to be ∼1.6 and ∼1.0 nm, respectively (
