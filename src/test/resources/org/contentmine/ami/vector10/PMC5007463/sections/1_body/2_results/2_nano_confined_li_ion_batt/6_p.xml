<p>This is very similar to the initial wetting layer on the graphene surface above (∼1.3 nm). The relative changes in thickness with each push-out step vary, depending on the actual distance before the step. During the first pushing steps at wider gaps, that is, larger distances from the lower limit in total thickness (3.6 nm) often larger steps in distance are observed, which we interpret as multiples of quantized single-molecular layers

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Thus, taking the intermolecular and interlayer electrostatic interactions into account, we speculate that EC-solvated Li ions form the mobile layers in the mica–graphene experiments, explaining also the differences in the mobility at the different interfaces. From all the described results it can be concluded that the mobility of the confined electrolyte layers increases in the order mica&lt;gold&lt;graphene. The flat profile across the mica–graphene interface and a homogeneous mirror shift during the experiments in confinement indicate the rather rigid structure of the films after restoring the contact. All experiments were repeated multiple times, showing similar trends with disks prepared separately. For graphene, the surfaces could be reused showing the same trends in the experiments, proving that no reaction with the electrolyte occurred at defect sites. The role of hydrophobicity on the wetting behaviour was also investigated by growing a hydrophobic 1-undecanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on a gold disk (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The wetting behaviour closely resembles the mica–gold experiment, rather than the more hydrophobic mica–graphene wetting experiment, indicating that graphene surface chemistry, not hydrophobicity, is a crucial factor in the wetting behaviour.
