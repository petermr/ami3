<p>The loss and/or consumption of recyclable lithium ions at the anode by the passive layer is a major cause of the reduction in the reversible capacity of the lithium ion battery [

 <xref rid="B52-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As the layer grows, lithium is consumed in the reaction and the increased thickness inhibits Li
 <sup>+</sup> transfer, thus the lithium ions must tunnel through the layer. This phenomenon is the main degradation mechanism in fully charged batteries at storage conditions [

 <xref rid="B55-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], where the electronic insulating surface layer formed clog the pores and isolate graphite particles. The irreversible lithium ion loss is also a function of the specific area of the graphite particles, since an increase in area increases the volume of reaction products [

 <xref rid="B57-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. For a graphite anode with low specific area, the charge loss is low. The electrolyte additive, vinylene carbonate (VC) is one that increases the lithium ion loss rate at the anode for the Li/coke electrode during storage (ambient temperature conditions). Because it increases the rate of SEI formation reaction at ambient temperature conditions to increase the SEI thickness. However, its beneficial effect is seen at higher temperature (35–50 °C) and higher voltages &gt;0.4 V for Li/coke, electrode as it slows down the side reaction rate and undergoes reduction and polymerization to form poly alkyl Li-carbonate species that suppress both solvent and salt anion reduction on the anode electrode.
