<p>The size of the graphite particles in the anode greatly influences the performance of the anode. Small particles contain short diffusion paths between the graphite particles, which facilitate fast charge and discharge rate [
 <xref rid="B71-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Similarly, the larger surface area of the smaller graphite particles are prone to higher internal heat generation and lithium ion are consumed during the exothermic reaction at high temperatures greater than 60 Â°C [
 <xref rid="B72-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] compared to larger particles size, this leads to an increase in the irreversible capacity of the graphite electrode [

 <xref rid="B75-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The area specific impedance (ASI) of the graphite particles remains constant and does not vary much with capacity of the battery until the maximum capacity is reached [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-06-01310-f006">Figure 6</xref> is a selected plot of graphite anode porosity data for prismatic and cylindrical (1.5 V) batteries cycled at 1C. An increase in porosity decreases the active surface area, reduces the electrical path into the graphite particles and reduces the accessibility of the lithium ions into the current collector. Although the pores will accommodate a large volume of electrolyte, they serve as a reaction point during the electrolyte decomposition process.
