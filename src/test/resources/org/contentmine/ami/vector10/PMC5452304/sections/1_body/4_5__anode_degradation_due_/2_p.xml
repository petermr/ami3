<p>Cycling the lithium ion batteries at high C-rate and high state of charge (SOC) induces mechanical strain on the graphite lattice of the anode electrode due the steep gradient of lithium ions, and thus lattice parameter, in the particle. This mechanical strain caused by the insertion and de-insertion of the lithium ions cracks, fissures and splits the graphite particles thus making these particles less oriented as compared to the original platelets [

 <xref rid="B61-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The nature and orientation of the graphite particles influences the reversible capacity of the anode. For instance, less-oriented graphite particles have a low reversible capacity due to more difficult lithium intercalation kinetics and to the formation of new boundaries between crystallite at which irreversible lithium ions/electrolyte interaction can occur [

 <xref rid="B66-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. While flake-like graphite particles have higher gravimetric capacity at higher C-rate compared to spherical particles [
 <xref rid="B67-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Although the crystal structure of the anode typically does not change with aging, a change in the rhombohederal/hexagonal content during battery operation has been reported. The increase in the hexagonal content during the first and third stage of lithium ions intercalation lowers Faradic efficiency, thereby decreasing the reversible capacity of the anode [

 <xref rid="B69-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], so ideally a high ratio of rhombohederal/hexagonal content which gives a high reversible capacity is most desired.
