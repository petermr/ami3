<p>Similarly, in batteries stored at voltages greater than 3.6V, electrolyte oxidation at the cathode can also induce surface reaction deposits that cover the active cathode electrode area. These covered areas are insulating, which could result in a non-homogeneous local current distribution in the cathode electrode.</p>
