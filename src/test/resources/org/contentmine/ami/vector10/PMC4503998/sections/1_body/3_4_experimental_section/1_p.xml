 <italic>Electrode Preparation</italic>: Positive composite electrodes (labelled LFP-CNT) were prepared by processing all components in water. These were: carbon-coated LiFePO

 <sup>−1</sup>; LFP P2, Südchemie/Clariant, Germany), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT Nanocyl-3101, Nanocyl, Belgium) and Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Walocel CRT 2000PA, Dow Wolff Cellulosics, Germany), in the weight ratio 60:30:10. CMC was firstly dissolved in milli-Q deionized water to obtain a 1 wt% solution. Afterwards, MWCNT were added to the binder solution and, in order to promote their dispersion, such an aqueous mixture was treated in an ultrasonic bath for 2 h. Subsequently, LFP was added to the obtained homogeneous slurry, further stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h, and then casted onto aluminium foil by the doctor blade technique (wet film thickness of 400 μm). Negative electrodes (labelled ZFO) were also processed in water by mixing carbon-coated ZnFe

 <sup>−1</sup>), conductive carbon (Super C65, TIMCAL, Switzerland), and CMC in the weight ratio 75:20:5. The thus obtained mixture was ball milled for 2 h and the resulting slurry was then cast on dendritic copper foil (Schlenk, wet film thickness: 120 μm). The electrode sheets were firstly dried at room temperature and then transferred to an oven set at 80 °C for further drying overnight. Positive and negative electrodes (with a mass loading of ≈1.8 and 1.2 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively) were then punched in disks (diameter: 12 mm) and dried for additional 12 h under vacuum at 180 °C prior to the electrochemical and morphological characterization.
