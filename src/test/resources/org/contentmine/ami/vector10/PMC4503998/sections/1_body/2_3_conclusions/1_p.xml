<p>In this work we proposed a novel battery configuration for high power applications. For the first time we have demonstrated, as a proof of concept, the highly promising features of lithium-ion full-cells combining carbon-coated ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> anodes and composite LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>-multi walled carbon nanotubes cathodes. ZFO/LFP-CNT cells showed remarkable rate capability retaining more than 50% of the initial capacity at C rates as high as ≈20C with respect to the limiting cathode. Moreover, a partial lithiation of the ZFO anode does not only enable an enhanced cycling stability of the full-cell, but does also result in an increased average full-cell discharge voltage while not substantially affecting the high rate performance. Among the investigated cells, the battery employing the negative electrode with the highest lithiation degree (600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, i.e., ZFO-600/LFP-CNT) showed the best performance, delivering a maximum specific energy and power of 202 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and 3.72 kW kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (these values refer to the total active material amount of both electrodes). Due to the high reversibility of this system, such cells show a stable cycling performance at high current (3 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, i.e., ≈10C with respect to LFP), showing a capacity retention of 85% after 10 000 cycles. In addition, 76% of the initial capacity is recovered when cycled subsequently applying lower current densities of, e.g., 0.5 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Beside the remarkable performance, a great advantage of this novel high power battery is represented by its environmental friendly nature. Zn and Fe are benign and highly abundant elements and both electrodes are produced via aqueous processing employing a cellulose-based binder.
