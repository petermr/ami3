 <caption>
  <p>Electrochemical performance of ZFO/LFP-CNT full-cells employing ZFO anodes with different degrees of lithiation. a) Cell voltage profiles for such cells upon galvanostatic cycling at 0.1 mA cm
   <sup>−2</sup> and influence of the lithiation degree on the average discharge voltage. b) Rate capability as function of the applied current density (from 0.1 to 6 mA cm
   <sup>−2</sup>) and c) relative voltage profiles of the individual electrodes and their influence on the overall cell voltage curves. Specific discharge capacity values are referred to the active material amount of both the limiting cathode (i.e., LFP) and the overall cell (i.e., TOT = LFP+ZFO).
