 <italic>Electrodes and Cells Characterization</italic>: The electrochemical measurements were carried out in three electrode Swagelok-type cells assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (MBraun, Germany; oxygen and water content &lt; 0.1 ppm). Polypropylene fleeces (Freudenberg FS 2226) were used as separators and drenched with 100 μL of electrolyte (1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylcarbonate (DEC) mixed in a 3:7 volume ratio). Half-cells, comprising battery grade metallic Li (Rockwood Lithium, Germany) serving as counter and reference electrodes, were used for: i) preliminary investigations on the LFP-CNT cathode performance, and ii) the ZFO anodes pre-formation/doping. The detailed characterization of the negative electrodes in half-cell configuration was already reported in detail by Bresser et al.
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> LFP-CNT composite electrodes were characterized by galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (2.8–4.2 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>) at current rates ranging from C/5 to 20C (i.e., from 0.034 to 3.4 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>). For the ZFO-based negative electrodes a pre-formation treatment in half-cells was performed, which was constituted of 20 galvanostatic cycles in the potential range 3–0.05 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at C/10 (i.e., 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and, for the partially lithiated ones, of a further reduction (21
 <sup>st</sup> cycle) limited to 200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (ZFO-200) or 600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (ZFO-600). Prior to their assembly in full-cells, the pre-formed anodes were disassembled in the glove box and rinsed with fresh electrolyte. In the full-cells, a reference electrode (metallic Li) was also employed for monitoring the individual electrode potentials. Upon galvanostatic cycling the operational potential windows for these were limited to 4.2–2.8 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> for the LFP-CNT cathode and 2.8–0.05 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> for the ZFO anode. Hence, the maximum cell voltage window allowed was 4.15 V. Rate capability tests were performed at current densities as high as 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, corresponding to almost 20C for LFP-CNT and 5C for ZFO. Impedance spectra of fresh and cycled (after 10 000 cycles) cells were collected under rest conditions (open circuit potential) in the frequency range comprised between 500 kHz and 10 mHz, with a sinusoidal amplitude of 5 mV. All electrochemical measurements were performed by means of a programmable multi-channel potentiostat-galvanostat (VMP3, Biologic Science Instruments) in a climatic chamber (KBF115, Binder GmbH) at 20 °C ± 2 °C. The morphology of both fresh and aged electrodes was also investigated by means of SEM. The cells containing the aged electrodes were disassembled in an Ar-filled glove box (MBraun), and the electrodes were carefully rinsed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In order to avoid contact with air and moisture, the samples have been transferred to the microscope using a homemade vacuum-sealed sample holder. Electrodes micrographs were acquired with a Carl Zeiss AURIGA Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with a field emission electron gun as electron source and an in-lens detector. The acceleration voltage was set to 3 kV.
