 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>a displays the voltage profiles of the full-cells during the first charge/discharge cycles at a very low current (i.e., 0.1 mA cm
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>). As expected, the partial lithiation of the negative electrode has a clear influence on the shape of the curves, which, in the case of ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, show the typical plateau of ZFO at 1 V (lithiation) and 1.5 V (de-lithiation) vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. The full-cell employing the ZFO-deLi anode displays a much steeper voltage profile instead. Besides, the aspect appearing most noteworthy is the influence of the negative electrode doping level on the average discharge voltage of the cell. While the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell has a relatively low cell voltage of 1.58 V, the ZFO-200 and ZFO-600 anodes operate in a more negative voltage range, thus enabling a considerable increase of the cell discharge potential up to 1.69 V and 2.12 V, respectively.
