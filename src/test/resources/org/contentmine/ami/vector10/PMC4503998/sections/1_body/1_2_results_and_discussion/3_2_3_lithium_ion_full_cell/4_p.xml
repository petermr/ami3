<p>Although it might appear surprising, this is a direct consequence of the previously mentioned incomplete utilization of the cathode material in the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell caused by the limiting anode during discharge. As a matter of fact, the positive electrode voltage does not approach its lower limit during the cell discharge (see left plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>c). This corresponds to a higher average cell voltage, but lower capacity. For the cell containing the ZFO-200 negative electrode, both electrodes are approaching their full discharge (center plot of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>c) and thus the LFP-CNT electrode voltage is steeply decreasing toward the end of the discharge. This means that the average voltage of the LFP electrode is lower than in the previous cell, which results in a lower average cell voltage. The cell capacity, however, is higher.
