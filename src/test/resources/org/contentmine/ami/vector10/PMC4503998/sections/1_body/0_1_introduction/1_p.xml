<p>The lithium-ion battery market is growing beyond expectations. The continuous progresses achieved by the development of new and/or enhanced materials has led to considerable improvements in terms of both energy and power densities.
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This has enabled, apart from the nowadays-established consumer electronics, further applications for lithium-ion batteries as, for instance, in the automotive sector (i.e., electric or hybrid vehicles). Nevertheless, there is still much room for improvement, especially concerning the high power density demanded by such kind of applications.
