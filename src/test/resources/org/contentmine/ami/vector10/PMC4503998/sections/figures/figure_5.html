 <caption> a) Long-term cycling stability applying a high current density of 3 mA cm âˆ’2 and the coulombic efficiency of ZFO/LFP-CNT full-cells employing anodes with different degrees of lithiation. b) Selected electrode and cell voltage profiles evolution upon cycling. Specific capacity values are referred to the active material amount of both the limiting cathode (i.e., LFP) and the sum of the anode and cathode (i.e., TOT = LFP+ZFO). </caption>
