<p>The volumetric capacity of Gr–Si was elucidated in comparison with those of the theoretical and commercial cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The volumetric capacity of 5 wt%-Gr–Si (for the electrode with 3.0 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) ranges from 2,500 to 3,000 mAh cm
 <sup>−3</sup>, which is close to the theoretical value (4,284 mAh cm
 <sup>−3</sup>) of the pristine Si particles on the assumption of their ideal packing (details in figure caption). The present values are far higher than that (550 mAh cm
 <sup>−3</sup>) of the current commercial graphite-based anodes. To further assess the practical viability of 5 wt%-Gr–Si, full cell performance was examined by pairing with a commercial cathode, LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>. By consideration of the average cell voltage of 3.5 V, the areal capacity of 3.0 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, and a total electrode thickness of 108 μm (electrode+separator+current collector, Gr–Si thickness=15 μm), the volumetric energy density of the present full cell reaches 972 Wh l
 <sup>−1</sup>. This value is remarkable since it is 1.8 times as large as that (550 Wh l
 <sup>−1</sup>) of widely used current commercial LIBs calculated based on the same metric(
