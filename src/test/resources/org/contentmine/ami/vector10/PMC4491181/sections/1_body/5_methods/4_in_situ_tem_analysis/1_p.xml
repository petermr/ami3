<p>The 
 <italic>in situ</italic> TEM experiments were performed in Titan 200 by using an electrical probing TEM holder. The Gr–Si NP solution was dropped onto a TEM grid until several Gr–Si NPs were located at the end of an Au wire electrode. Li metal was scratched onto a cleaved Pt/Ir electrode to generate a Li/Li
 <sub>2</sub>O counter electrode. The entire procedure for the sample loading was carried out in a dry room (&lt;55 °C dew point, &lt;0.5 % relative humidity at 25 °C). The TEM holder was moved to the TEM instrument inside a sealing box, and the holder was exposed to air for &lt;30 s before being loaded into the TEM chamber. The manipulation of the probe tip was precisely controlled by a piezo-electric motor in order to make physical contacts between Gr–Si NPs and Li metal counter electrode. After secure contact was made, a constant bias from −0.5 to −5 V was applied. The microstructure evolution during lithiation was recorded as a movie clip.
