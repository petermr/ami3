  <inline-graphic id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms8393-i1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>The volume expansion of silicon is a big problem in lithium-ion batteries with silicon anodes. Here, the authors report direct graphene growth on silicon nanoparticles, which effectively mitigates the problem, leading to excellent electrochemical performance.
