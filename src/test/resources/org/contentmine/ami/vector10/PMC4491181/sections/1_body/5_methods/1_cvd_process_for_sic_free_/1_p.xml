<p>For direct growth of graphene over the surface of Si NPs (Gr–Si), pristine Si NPs (average diameter ∼100 nm, Nanostructured and Amorphous Materials, Inc.) were introduced into a fixed-bed vertical tube reactor made of quartz (inner diameter=9 mm; refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). The test gas was flowed through a reactor-containing bed from the top at atmospheric pressure. The loading of Si NPs in each batch was 0.1 g. Initially, the system was heated to target temperatures (900, 1,000 and 1,100 °C) at a ramping rate of 23 °C min

 <sub>2</sub> was flowed. The temperature was maintained for 10 and 20 min, which results in 1 and 5 wt% of carbon content, respectively. The system was then cooled to room temperature (25 °C) in the presence of the mixed gas flow. For the synthesis of SiC–Si, the system is first heated to 1,000 °C (23 °C min

 <sub>2</sub> gas flowed at a rate of 100 s.c.c.m. This process was maintained for 60 min to reduce the native oxide layer over Si NPs. Next, the gas mixture consisting of 50 s.c.c.m. CH

 <sub>2</sub> was introduced for 10 min. AC–Si was synthesized by a known pyrolysis process (400 °C, 30 min) using citric acid as a carbon precursor
