 <caption> SiC-free graphene growth on Si NPs. ( a) A low-magnification TEM image of Gr–Si NP. ( b) A higher-magnification TEM image for the same Gr–Si NP from the white box in a. (Insets) The line profiles from the two red boxes indicate that the interlayer spacing between graphene layers is ∼3.4 Å, in good agreement with that of typical graphene layers based on van der Waals interaction. ( c) A high-magnification TEM image visualizing the origins (red arrows) from which individual graphene layers grow. ( d) A schematic illustration showing the sliding process of the graphene coating layers that can buffer the volume expansion of Si. </caption>
