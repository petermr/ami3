<p>The SiC electrode was lithiated under potentiostatic conditions at 10 mV (almost short circuit conditions), until the current had dropped to an effective C/20 rate and the flowed electric charge had reached 93% of the theoretical electrode capacity. All image, phase retrieval and reconstruction parameters were identical, except a 20 × microscope was used, resulting in a smaller 832 μm × 390 μm field of view, but higher resolution (0.325 μm × 0.325 μm pixel size). This way, data quality and effective spatial resolution (∼1–1.5 μm, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 9</xref>) on the microstructural level could be further enhanced and the rather small silicon particles could be better resolved.
