<p>Interestingly, the formation of rigid and mobile interfacial layers suggests a minimum confined thin-film thickness that forms between atomically smooth surfaces without applied external potentials. We expect that the presence of stacked rigid and mobile layers in the direct vicinity of the film is necessary for effective transport and higher diffusion of ion pairs in confined gaps. Thus, for electroactive interfaces
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, such as electrodes in Li-ion batteries, pores need be wide enough to contain both the rigid layer and the mobile lithium-containing layers for efficient transport of Li-ions in and out of the pores. The exact mechanisms will be very important when manufacturing nanostructured materials, as it can be correlated to the critical pore thickness for a material to be wet by a (re)active electrolyte.
