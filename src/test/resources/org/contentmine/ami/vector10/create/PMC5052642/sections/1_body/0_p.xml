<p>During lithium ion battery (LIB) operation, lithium ions react with the electrochemically active material in the porous electrodes, driving morphological changes in the active materials, which in turn can influence the electrode microstructure
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Not only electrochemical performance is dependent on material morphology and electrode microstructure, but electrochemical degradation and failure is often associated with non-reversible changes to the microstructure or inhomogeneities within it (refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). To improve LIB performance and longevity, it is therefore crucial to understand local electrochemical activity and the resulting changes in lithium distribution within the electrodes, as well as dynamic morphological changes occurring in the electrode microstructures during battery operation. This manuscript presents a generalized method by which the electrochemical activity and microstructural dynamics during battery operation can be tracked. We examine graphite-containing electrodes because they are the most prevalent type of LIB anodes and present several challenges to visualization and quantification that until now have not been overcome.
