<p>To summarize, a qualitative inspection of the vector fields reveals the motion of the electrode and the graphite particles during (de)lithation. In the following sections, we explain how to analyse these vector fields to quantify the electrochemical activity within the electrodes and the corresponding microstructural changes.</p>
