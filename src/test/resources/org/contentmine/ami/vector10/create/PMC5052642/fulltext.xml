Weak X-ray attenuation of graphite and, as a result, poor contrast between graphite and the other carbon-based components in an electrode pore space renders data analysis challenging. Here we demonstrate <italic>operando</italic> tomography of weakly attenuating electrodes during electrochemical (de)lithiation. We use propagation-based phase contrast tomography to facilitate the differentiation between weakly attenuating materials and apply digital volume correlation to capture the dynamics of the electrodes during operation. After validating that we can quantify the local electrochemical activity and microstructural changes throughout graphite electrodes, we apply our technique to graphite-silicon composite electrodes. We show that microstructural changes that occur during (de)lithiation of a pure graphite electrode are of the same order of magnitude as spatial inhomogeneities within it, while strain in composite electrodes is locally pronounced and introduces significant microstructural changes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Not only electrochemical performance is dependent on material morphology and electrode microstructure, but electrochemical degradation and failure is often associated with non-reversible changes to the microstructure or inhomogeneities within it (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). To improve LIB performance and longevity, it is therefore crucial to understand local electrochemical activity and the resulting changes in lithium distribution within the electrodes, as well as dynamic morphological changes occurring in the electrode microstructures during battery operation. This manuscript presents a generalized method by which the electrochemical activity and microstructural dynamics during battery operation can be tracked. We examine graphite-containing electrodes because they are the most prevalent type of LIB anodes and present several challenges to visualization and quantification that until now have not been overcome.</p><p>Synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy (XTM) has received widespread attention in the field of LIBs as it allows for non-invasive imaging of electrode microstructures with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Approaches (i) and (ii) can be performed with X-rays at a single energy and rely on the change in the number density of active material atoms (volume is inversely proportional to density and the X-ray attenuation coefficient is proportional to density). Approach (iii) is based on absorption spectroscopy and relies on the change of oxidation state of one or more species of host atoms. Analysing the lithium distribution in an electrode with any of these three techniques requires that the active material be distinguishable from other solid phases and from the pore space within the electrodes.</p><p>For these reasons, <italic>in-situ</italic> XTM studies have been predominantly carried out on electrode materials containing rather heavy elements. Techniques (i) and (ii) have been proven suitable for tin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and germanium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> alloying anodes that undergo large volumetric and attenuation coefficient changes beyond 200&#x00025; (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) on lithiation, which allows the lithium distribution to be deduced rather precisely. Technique (iii) has been most successfully applied to track the oxidation state changes of transition metals in cathode materials on lithiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>For graphite, none of these three techniques is promising. First, carbon (Z=6) is weakly attenuating for hard X-rays, resulting in low contrast between it and the electrolyte-filled pore space. This in combination with edge enhancement artefacts in such systems renders data binarization particularly challenging. Secondly, even if binarization is possible, the volumetric and attenuation coefficient changes are only 10.5&#x00025; (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and &#x02212;11.4&#x00025; (at 10&#x02009;keV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> respectively on full lithiation of graphite from C<sub>6</sub> (delithiated) to LiC<sub>6</sub> (lithiated), making intercalation hard to track and prone to segmentation errors. Finally, graphite does not exhibit any absorption edges in a feasible energy range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. It is therefore not surprising that optical studies on the lithiation dynamics of graphite have been the most successful ones so far, since the various Li<sub>x</sub>C<sub>6</sub> phases change colour from black to blue to red to golden on lithiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>To investigate dynamic lithium distribution and microstructure evolution, we propose a twofold approach. First, we apply digital volume correlation (DVC)&#x02014;previously used to study two-dimensional (2D) strains in graphite electrodes using an optical cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, deformations in a Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> containing commercial coin cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and commercial primary batteries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>- to the time-resolved set of tomographic data to precisely track even small deformations within the graphite electrodes as function of three-dimensional (3D) space and time. On the basis of these morphological changes, the electrochemical activity may be mapped throughout the electrodes. While a major advantage of DVC when applied to weakly attenuating materials is that it does not rely on error-prone data binarization procedures, binarization remains necessary for microstructural analysis.</p><p>Second, we therefore enrich the image contrast obtained with standard attenuation-based XTM measurements by making use of emerging X-ray phase contrast techniques. Coherent X-rays produced by synchrotrons probe the complex refractive index <italic>n</italic>=(1&#x02212;<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>)&#x0002b;<italic>i&#x003b2;</italic> of a sample. While attenuation contrast tomography maps the imaginary part of the refractive index (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, representing beam attenuation), phase contrast tomography maps the real part of the refractive index (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>, representing beam deflection). Phase contrast tomography often requires more complicated measurement setups and is typically more prone to different types of artefacts than attenuation contrast tomography. However, it enhances the contrast between different weakly attenuating materials.</p><p>Different fully quantitative and semi-quantitative methods for phase contrast tomography have been developed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

Although paganin phase contrast (PPC) is fully quantitative only if (i) the sample consists of a single homogeneous material phase and a void phase and (ii) the ratio <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> of the real and the imaginary parts of the material's X-ray refractive index is known, it has been applied to multiphase samples, including weakly attenuating lithium dendrites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, graphite electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and lithium sulphur electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.

Using PPC and optimizing the ratio <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> only slightly compromises the effective resolution while allowing for improved contrast needed for binarization. DVC enables us to quantify the electrochemical activity throughout the electrodes, and, in combination with PPC, to perform a dynamic microstructure analysis. After validating this approach using well-studied graphite electrodes, we show that it can be applied to study the lithiation dynamics and structural evolution of graphite-silicon composite anodes for the next generation of LIBs.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Paganin phase contrast tomography</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> schematically depicts the measurement setup.

We use a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, where 57&#x02009;s long current pulses alternate with 3&#x02009;s long open circuit relaxation times. A potentiostatic step at the cut-off potential is added to ensure that all lithium ions migrate between the electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref> shows corresponding subsections of vertical cuts through the tomograms at different states of charge (SOC).

On lithiation, the bottom electrode has slightly expanded in the through-plane (TP) direction, while the top electrode has contracted in the same direction on delithiation.

DVC calculates a vector displacement field that maps two volumetric images locally on one another by maximizing the cross correlations between iteratively refined sub-volumes in the respective data sets. From the calculated vector fields, spatially resolved quantities like strain or relative volume expansion can be deduced.</p><p>To obtain a qualitative picture of electrode dynamics, we look at cuts C1, C2 and C3 through the electrodes, as indicated by the magenta planes in the sketch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the horizontal slice C2 through the middle of the top electrode with the superimposed vector field correlating the first with the last scan. Vector arrows point towards an anchor point close to the middle of the electrode, indicating that the electrode contracts within the plane parallel to the current collector (in-plane directions, IP<sub>1</sub> &#x00026; IP<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) on delithiation. In contrast, for a slice C3 through the bottom electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), the arrows point outwards, indicating that the electrode expands in the IP directions during lithiation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref> shows the displacement field throughout the whole stack. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref> shows magnifications of the image data and the displacement field in the full computationally available spatial resolution (one vector arrow in 32 &#x000d7; 32 &#x000d7; 32 voxels<sup>3</sup>). The domain taken from the electrode edge (orange box) reveals that the cell housing blocks expansion of the electrode in the IP direction and the domain from the centre of the electrode (blue box) shows a weak random displacement field at the particle scale superimposed on the radial fields describing the overall volumetric changes of the electrode. This indicates that particles and pores of the microstructure slightly deform and reorder with respect to one another during the course of (de)lithiation. The dipole shaped vector field superimposed on the vertical cut C1 through both electrodes and the separator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) complements the observations from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref> in the TP direction: the glass fibre separator moves upwards, the top electrode contracts, and the bottom electrode expands. The overall volume of the sample remains almost unaffected on a full (de)lithiation, which is expected because of the symmetric cell design and the conservation of charge and mass within the sample.</p><p>We further determine that within the graphite electrodes, microstructural changes occur predominantly along the TP direction. The IP vector field components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>) are on the order of only 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (arrows are scaled by a factor 60), while the TP vector field components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) represent an average displacement of 10&#x02013;20&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (scaling factor 8). The origin of this is twofold: first graphite expands predominantly along its <italic>c</italic>-axis, which corresponds to the shortest dimension of the active particles. As most particles align with their flat side parallel to the current collector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, the electrode will favour expansion along the TP direction. Second, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> (vector arrows scaled by a factor of 8), the cell housing constrains further expansion in the IP directions.</p><p>To summarize, a qualitative inspection of the vector fields reveals the motion of the electrode and the graphite particles during (de)lithation. In the following sections, we explain how to analyse these vector fields to quantify the electrochemical activity within the electrodes and the corresponding microstructural changes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantifying electrochemical activity using DVC</title><p>Because graphite expands on lithiation, we propose to quantify the electrochemical activity in the electrodes as a function of 3D space and time by calculating the volumetric strain profiles in the electrodes. The relative volumetric change is defined as the divergence of the displacement field, <inline-formula id="d33e527"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e528" xlink:href="ncomms12909-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq2"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e533" xlink:href="ncomms12909-m2.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> we explain the relations between different types of strain and the displacement field. For example, the dynamic shear strain distribution within the electrodes can be used to detect crack formation at the electrode level.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, we map out the volumetric strain distributions within the electrodes as a function of the SOC by correlating the scans at the different SOCs with the 0&#x00025; SOC scan. The maps indicate that the top electrode (top row) is gradually contracting while the bottom electrode (row in the middle) is expanding. From the vertical cuts (bottom row), it is evident that, up to 48&#x00025; SOC, volumetric strains occur rather homogeneously in all parts of the lithiating bottom electrode, while at &#x0003e;50&#x00025; SOC, &#x02018;strain fronts' progress from the electrode-separator interfaces towards the bottom current collector. On the contrary, the delithiating top electrode shows inhomogeneous contraction behaviour, where multiple &#x02018;strain fronts' subsequently progress from the separator&#x02013;electrode interface towards the top current collector. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 2&#x02013;4</xref> show the volumetric strain in all 29 time steps.</p><p>To further quantify these observations, we slice the electrodes along planes at equidistantly spaced positions in the TP direction and spatially integrate the divergences of the displacement fields within each of the resulting cylindrical sub-volumes for all time steps. This provides the relative volumetric changes of the electrode sub-sections as a function of the flowed specific charge:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq3"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e554" xlink:href="ncomms12909-m3.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>The resulting plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> shows the per cent volumetric change versus the SOC for the electrode sub-sections at varying distances from the separator. In agreement with our findings from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, we find that both electrodes expand (contract) by &#x0223c;6&#x00025; on average (blue curves) during the course of lithiation (delithiation). Furthermore, we find that (i) the delithiating top electrode contracts progressively along the TP direction, starting from the section closest to the separator and then towards the current collector, and (ii) the lithiating bottom electrode shows a homogeneous expansion throughout the entire electrode up to about 50&#x00025; SOC followed by a progressive expansion of portions of the electrode beginning with the section closest to the separator.</p><p>We now show how DVC-based analysis of volumetric strain can provide insights into electrochemical behaviour. Our analysis leads to two observations: (i) lithiation starts at the electrode&#x02013;separator interfaces and progresses towards the current collectors and (ii) SOC gradients build-up immediately in the delithiating electrode, while they develop only during the second half of the experiment in the lithiating electrode. The first observation is consistent with our understanding from literature that lithiation kinetics within graphite electrodes are limited by ionic diffusion and conductivity rather than by electric conductivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The second observation can be understood by plotting the first electrochemical cycle of a lithium metal/graphite half cell that has been slowly operated at a galvanostatic C/10 rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). During our <italic>operando</italic> experiment, the top electrode will behave similarly to the delithiation curve (black line), while the bottom electrode will behave as the lithiation curve (red line). The larger average slope of the lithiation curve implies that overpotentials developing along the TP direction will induce only smaller SOC gradients within the lithiating bottom electrode, while the smaller slope of the delithiation curve suggests that overpotentials can trigger larger SOC variations within the delithiating top electrode. From the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, inset) used during the experiment, we estimate the overpotential to be approximately 20&#x02009;mV, or equivalently &#x00394;&#x003a6;=10&#x02009;mV per electrode. According to the calculated slopes, this can lead to SOC variations of <inline-formula id="d33e576"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e577" xlink:href="ncomms12909-m4.jpg"/></inline-formula> within the top electrode during the first half of the experiment, while the expected SOC variation within the bottom electrode is below 1 &#x00025;. Only in the second half of the experiment corresponding to the flat regime of the lithiation curve, can gradients also develop in the bottom electrode. The agreement between the expected behaviour of graphite during (de)lithiation and our observations in tomography indicate that for low attenuation contrast and small volume expansion materials such as graphite, DVC is a robust method for tracking small changes in microstructure that can be correlated to electrochemical activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microstructural analysis on dynamic volumes</title><p>Next we demonstrate that our imaging and analysis approach can be used to determine whether the mechanical deformation of the porous electrodes during the (de)lithiation process impacts the transport of lithium ions in the electrode.

In contrast to DVC, which operates directly on the raw data, quantification of microstructural parameters, such as porosity or tortuosity, requires data binarization. Additionally, for a dynamically evolving microstructure, determination of microstructural parameters requires the analysis of sub-volumes containing the same particles and pores for each time step.</p><p>To create dynamic sub-volumes, we use the information readily available from DVC to warp an initial volumetric observation window according to the corresponding computed displacement fields in each time step. This concept is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> using a small part of the bottom electrode, shown before lithation on the left. During lithiation, the particles in this sub-volume expand, distorting the sub-volume shape. The sub-volume containing the same set of particles is shown in the very last time step (right). For better visibility, the computed displacement field (middle) and the warping effect (right) have been rescaled by a factor 40 in the IP directions and by a factor 6 in the TP direction. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 5</xref> visualizes this dynamically deforming subvolume.</p><p>The chosen <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> ratio in the PPC tomography reconstruction provides the appropriate trade-off between resolution and contrast such that each data set can be binarized into a particle phase and an electrolyte/binder/carbon black background phase using Huang's method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).

The overall electrode expands by almost 7&#x00025; (blue curve), consistent with our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, and the particles (black curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) expand by more than 10&#x00025;, in excellent agreement with literature where it is reported that the crystal lattice of graphite expands predominantly along its <italic>c</italic>-axis direction by approximately 10.5&#x00025; on a full lithiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The porosity (red curve) first slightly decreases from 48 to 46&#x00025;, but then remains at 46&#x00025; for the second half of the lithiation because the particles expand more than the overall electrode only during the first half of lithiation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref> shows the absolute and relative values of the tortuosity along the two IP and the TP direction as a function of time. These values have been calculated on a smaller dynamic volume (initial size: 350 &#x000d7; 350 &#x000d7; 250 voxels<sup>3</sup>=227.5 &#x000d7; 227.5 &#x000d7; 162.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>), which is sufficiently large for variations due to spatial inhomogeneities in the microstructure to not influence the result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). The large anisotropy (factor of two) between the IP tortuosities and the TP tortuosity arises from the fact that the graphite particles are platelet shaped and tend to align with their flat-side parallel to the current collector, which results in significantly longer diffusion paths along the TP direction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, while the TP tortuosity is constant over time, the IP tortuosities increase by &#x0223c;2&#x00025; during the course of lithiation. This effect could arise from the graphite platelets expanding predominately along their c-axis direction, thereby narrowing the diffusion paths along the IP directions. Again, as the rate of electrode expansion overtakes the rate of particle expansion (above 50&#x00025; SOC), the IP tortuosities no longer increase.</p><p>As described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>, use of dynamical volumes enables further types of microstructural analysis techniques.</p><p>In summary, for the relatively porous electrode in this cell (designed to keep pressure in order to maintain good electrochemistry, but still accomodating volumetric changes of the sample in the TP direction) lithium transport will not be significantly affected by the reduction in porosity and the narrowing of the pore space (increasing <italic>&#x003c4;</italic>). The temporal changes in microstructure that occur during lithiation are on the same order of magnitude as the spatial microstructure inhomogeneities across the electrode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). However, we emphasize that these finding are electrode and cell specific. Different electrode preparation (for example, lower porosity) or cell configurations (for example, wound versus stacked) could result in sections of the electrode that experience significant changes in the microstructure.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>For the case of the graphite electrode, our findings confirm much of what was known or what could be logically hypothesized about (de)lithation of graphite electrodes. We observe that, even in our relatively porous electrodes, lithium transport through the pore space is limited ionically rather than electrically, resulting in a lithation front and large SOC gradients. Expansion in the electrode is strongly anisotropic, stemming from the directional expansion of the graphite flakes that are mostly aligned with their flat side parallel to the current collector. The expansion of the particle phase during lithiation by &#x0223c;10&#x00025; is mostly accommodated by the expansion of the electrode as a whole (6&#x02013;7&#x00025;), while the fraction of the active phase increases only slightly, leading to small changes in porosity and tortuosity. These changes in microstructure are on the order of the local inhomogenieties of the graphite electrode itself, and therefore do not significantly worsen the electrochemical performance of the cell. Finally, we observed that the cell housing locally affects the expansion of the electrodes indicating that, depending on the type of cell (pouch or wound), its size, and the packaging materials, the extent of particle expansion that can be accommodated by expansion of the electrode may vary.</p><p>Having validated our approach with graphite electrodes, we apply it to study electrodes containing graphite blended with small amounts of silicon (SiC electrodes). SiC electrodes have recently found widespread attention as a solution that enhances the specific charge capacity of the electrode (silicon exhibits a one order of magnitude higher specific charge capacity (3578, mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)) than graphite (372&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)), while limiting the volumetric changes of the electrode on electrochemical operation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> (silicon expands by more than 280&#x00025; (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) on alloying with lithium, which, when it is the only active material in an electrode, causes severe degradation of the battery performance on prolonged cycling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In fact, only 20&#x02009;wt&#x00025; silicon in the electrode are in theory sufficient to triple the specific charge capacity from 372 to 1013, mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. SiC electrodes present similar challenges as graphite electrodes for dynamic imaging in 3D, but, unlike for graphite electrodes, the distribution of electrochemical activity and microstructural dynamics in SiC electrodes are not well understood. Due to the large volumetric change of silicon on (de)lithiation, mechanical deformation within SiC electrodes is expected to be (i) overall significantly stronger and (ii) more heterogeneous compared with pure graphite electrodes.</p><p>To investigate the mechanical deformation and electrochemical activity occurring in a SiC electrode during lithiation, as well as the influence of the two types of particle expansion on the microstructure and subsequent electrode performance, we repeat the experiment described above on an electrode containing the same graphite particles mixed with micron-sized silicon particles in a weight ratio of 3:1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> shows a rendering of a part of the electrode in the pristine state, where the more attenuating silicon particles are depicted in yellow and the less attenuating graphite particles are depicted in red.</p><p>To lithiate the high capacity SiC electrode without the risk of plating on a similar time scale as the graphite electrode, we apply 10&#x02009;mV potentiostatic conditions right from the beginning until the current has dropped to an effective C/20 rate and the flowed electric charge has reached 93&#x00025; of the theoretical electrode capacity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref> summarizes the flowed electric charge and the voltage as a function of time. The blue bars indicate the tomographic scans, which are acquired approximately every 20&#x02009;min.</p><p>To visualize the time- and space-dependent electrochemical activity of silicon and graphite within the electrode, we again turn to DVC and compute the divergence of the displacement fields in each time step. Because electrode deformations and changes in local X-ray attenuation are much larger in the presence of silicon, a smaller SOC increment improves the accuracy of the DVC results. We therefore compute the cumulated divergence at scan number k from the DVC fields <inline-formula id="d33e730"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e731" xlink:href="ncomms12909-m6.jpg"/></inline-formula> relating subsequent tomographic scans j and j&#x0002b;1, that is:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq7"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e735" xlink:href="ncomms12909-m7.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> shows the results superimposed on IP and TP cuts through the electrode. We observe a pronounced and clear correlation between material type and expansion characteristic: the domains of strongest expansion (up to 65&#x00025;) coincide with the positions of the silicon particles. The graphite particles, pore space, and separator expand less or are even compressed by the expanding silicon domains.</p><p>Comparing the magnitudes of the displacement fields along the different directions, we find that the electrode expands &#x0223c;25 times more in the TP direction as compared with the IP directions. As the expansion mostly stems from spherical polycrystalline silicon particles with isotropic lithiation properties, this anisotropy can only be explained by the cell housing confinement, which limits expansion along the IP directions.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 6&#x02013;8</xref> show horizontal and vertical cuts through the dynamically lithiating SiC electrode superimposed with the corresponding strain distributions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5d</xref> quantifies the expansion of the SiC electrode using (i) the 3D spatial average of the cumulated divergence within the electrode and (ii) the electrode thickness as determined directly from the tomographic scans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). The mean correlation values of all DVC computations exceed 90&#x00025; and the results from the two methods are in excellent agreement with each other. The results indicate that the SiC electrode expansion occurs linearly as a function of the SOC. This is in contrast to graphite, where both the electrode volume and particle volume are nonlinear functions of the SOC (compare ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Linear expansion as a function of SOC is characteristic for silicon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). This observation suggests that the electrodes inherit their expansion characteristics from the expansion properties of the constituent particles, and that the expansion of the SiC electrode is dominated by the expansion of silicon.</p><p>Finally, we briefly consider the effect of this particle expansion on the microstructure of the SiC electrode. Based on the known chemical composition of the pristine electrode, its mass, its geometric surface area, and its thickness, we estimate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 7</xref>) the volume fractions of graphite, silicon, and pore space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). We compare these results against those obtained from a trinarization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 8</xref>) of the electrode microstructure in the same three phases (blue numbers). The lithiation of silicon leads to both an expansion of the overall electrode by 35&#x00025; and a reduction of the porosity by 8&#x00025;, indicating that, on lithiation, the silicon spreads into the pore space, changing the microstructure, and most likely influencing the lithium transport within the electrodes.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that a combination of <italic>operando</italic> X-ray tomographic microscopy, PPC, and DVC enables the analysis of the lithiation dynamics and microstructural evolution occurring in LIB electrodes during cycling, thereby guiding the design of next-generation battery electrodes. We validated this combination of techniques on graphite electrodes, which are perhaps the most challenging of all LIB electrodes for X-ray imaging because of the weak attenuation of graphite. We then applied the same set of techniques to study a silicon-graphite composite electrode during the course of lithiation.

Furthermore, our results show that DVC can be used to obtain the dynamic volumes needed for realistic modelling and simulation of 3D electrode microstructures, as well as accurate calculation of microstructural parameters such as porosity and tortuosity as a function of electrode SOC. Quantifying the microstructural changes occurring in an electrode during (de)lithiation enabled us to gain insight into how lithium transport is influenced by the dynamic microstructure.

The linear system of equations was assembled based on the routines developed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and solved iteratively using MATLAB's pre-implemented &#x02018;bicgstabl' iterative solver and incomplete LU factorization (MATLAB's built-in &#x02018;ilu' algorithm).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data binarization and trinarization</title><p>For the graphite&#x02013;graphite sample no pre-processing steps were applied to the data.
