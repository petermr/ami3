<p>Its light weight, high voltage and high energy density once made lithium metal foil the preferred anode electrode for the lithium ion battery. However, its propensity to the formation of dendrites and moss made it unattractive. In the light if this, many more anode materials have been developed to replace the lithium metal foil as an anode material. Common anode materials currently used in lithium ion batteries include graphite, coke, hard carbon and lithium titanate. Among these, the unmodified graphite electrode is most susceptible to lithium plating because of the close proximity of its reversible potential to that of Li

Lithium plating by itself is reversible, as the plated lithium oxidizes at potential of about 100mV, a potential much lower than that of lithium de-intercalation at the anode electrode, causing a voltage overshoot during the discharge cycle (over potential) as shown in

Well-ordered carbon and non-graphitizable carbon have gradually replaced lithium metal as the preferred anode material for the lithium ion battery because of their superior capacity, good cycleability, lower susceptibility to lithium plating, and low electrode potential relative to Li
