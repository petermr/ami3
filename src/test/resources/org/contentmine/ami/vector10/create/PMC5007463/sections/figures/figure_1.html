 <caption> SFA set-up and graphene disk synthesis and analysis. ( a) Crossed cylinder experimental set-up of the SFA-2000. ( b) FECO in graphene–mica-opposing materials. ( c) Schematic illustration of the synthesis of graphene on a silica disk. ( d) Atomic-force microscopy linescan and analyses of graphene layers deposited on sputtered iridium (black) and on EB-PVD iridium (red) on silica disks, indicating the measured σ RMS over areas larger than 25 μm 2. ( e) Raman spectra of graphene layers deposited on sputtered iridium (black) and on EB-PVDed iridium (red) on silica disks. </caption>
