 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The classical way of performing a force-run was not possible in these experiments because of the strong layering and limited range of motors (even with very stiff springs). The rigid layer formation could only be studied by applying very high pressures using micrometre-driven approaches. A force run in aqueous electrolytes with the graphene disks is shown in
