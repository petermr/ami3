<p>Since the pioneering work of metal oxides anodes for lithium ion batteries by Tarascon in 2001 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), more conversion materials including oxides, nitrides, fluorides and sulfides have been developed as anodes. Similar to alloy anodes, conversion anodes often suffer from low initial efficiency and severe capacity fading, originating from causes such as unstable SEI layers, material structural degradation and large volume change. Here we design a specific large-scale hierarchical structured electrode assembly, a freestanding 3D array of core–shell nanostructures, to tackle these issues. Based on above material characterizations and electrochemical measurements, the 3D CuO/CN

 </sub> shell encapsulates the CuO electrode, limiting most SEI formation to the outer surface instead of directly on CuO active materials; at the same time, the core–shell nanostructure helps reversible accommodation of the volume change of the CuO active material. Similar approaches have also been reported in CuO@graphene and Si@C composites

In the full-cell design, both cathode-limited capacity design and electrochemical prelithiation technique for the nanocomposite anodes are used to address the impact of initial capacity loss in the anode. These techniques have been well investigated and are now widely used, particularly for cells employing alloy and conversion anode materials
