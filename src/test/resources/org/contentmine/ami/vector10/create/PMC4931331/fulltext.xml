A long-standing obstacle has been metal-ion dissolution at high voltages. The LiPF<sub>6</sub> salt in conventional electrolytes is chemically unstable, which accelerates transition metal dissolution of the electrode material, yet beneficially suppresses oxidative dissolution of the aluminium current collector; replacing LiPF<sub>6</sub> with more stable lithium salts may diminish transition metal dissolution but unfortunately encounters severe aluminium oxidation. Here we report an electrolyte design that can solve this dilemma. By mixing a stable lithium salt LiN(SO<sub>2</sub>F)<sub>2</sub> with dimethyl carbonate solvent at extremely high concentrations, we obtain an unusual liquid showing a three-dimensional network of anions and solvent molecules that coordinate strongly to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions. This simple formulation of superconcentrated LiN(SO<sub>2</sub>F)<sub>2</sub>/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte inhibits the dissolution of both aluminium and transition metal at around 5&#x02009;V, and realizes a high-voltage LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/graphite battery that exhibits excellent cycling durability, high rate capability and enhanced safety.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

To approach the high energy-density requirements for automobiles, a pragmatic approach is to elevate the operating voltage of batteries, from the present 4&#x02009;V to around 5&#x02009;V (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This allows the direct application of the mature fabrication technology of 4&#x02009;V-class lithium-ion batteries, the well-developed negative electrodes (for example, graphite and graphite/silicon), and high-voltage positive electrodes (for example, spinel LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and some layered oxides). However, new challenges&#x02014;which mainly arise from the electrolyte&#x02014;hinder the practical application of the next-generation 5&#x02009;V-class battery.</p><p>One major problem is metal dissolution from the positive electrode at high voltages, which poses a serious dilemma in designing an electrolyte. In state-of-the-art lithium-ion electrolyte, chemically unstable LiPF<sub>6</sub> is an essential component to suppress anodic (oxidative) dissolution of an aluminium current collector because its hydrolysis product of hydrofluoric acid (HF) contributes to an insoluble AlF<sub>3</sub> passivation film<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, the generated HF accelerates the dissolution of transition metals from the active electrode materials, which causes severe capacity decay upon cycling, especially at high voltages and elevated temperatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Using LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as an example, the dissolved Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions, albeit &#x0003c;1&#x00025; of the total amount, deposit on the surface of the graphite negative electrode, which thicken the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) by catalysing the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte, and consume the limited lithium reserve in the battery to result in a &#x0003e;50&#x00025; capacity loss in 100 charge/discharge cycles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.

Efforts have tried more stable salts (less tendency to generate HF) to replace LiPF<sub>6</sub>, such as lithium perfluorosulfonylamide (shortened to &#x02018;amide')<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, the chemically stable amide does not participate in the reaction with Al to form a stable passivation film, thus causing severe anodic dissolution of the Al current collector at &#x0003e;4&#x02009;V (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). As a result, it remains a dilemma for electrolyte design to suppress both the Al dissolution (requiring an unstable salt) and transition metal dissolution (avoiding an unstable salt). Recently, increasing the concentration of amide salts was reported to alleviate anodic Al dissolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, but the operating voltage of a half-cell is still limited below 4.3&#x02009;V, presumably owing to some or all of the following reasons: insufficient salt concentration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, too low ionic conductivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and too low oxidative stability of the solvent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we report an electrolyte system to resolve the dilemma. We select stable yet dissociative lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSA) as the salt and oxidation-stable carbonate esters as the solvent. We demonstrate an unusual liquid with a peculiar three-dimensional structural network obtained at extremely high salt concentrations. The superconcentrated electrolyte not only effectively suppresses the anodic Al dissolution but also remarkably inhibits the transition metal dissolution and, thus, realizes a safe, stable and fast-rate high-voltage LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|graphite battery.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Physicochemical properties</title><p>LiFSA salt was dissolved at various concentrations into three different carbonate ester solvents: dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC) and mixed EC:DMC. All the mixtures are transparent liquids at room temperature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> as an example). Their basic physicochemical properties are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> shows their viscosity as a function of salt concentration. Independent of the solvents used, the viscosity increases exponentially with increasing the LiFSA mole fraction (<italic>X</italic><sub>LiFSA</sub>). Among the three groups of solutions, the group with DMC as the solvent shows the lowest viscosity because pure DMC has a lower viscosity than pure EC or mixed EC:DMC. For electrolytes with similar solvation radiuses of mobile ions, the ionic conductivity is proportional to the number of mobile ions and inversely proportional to the viscosity of the medium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, at dilute concentrations of <italic>X</italic><sub>LiFSA</sub>&#x0003c;0.14 (below 1.5&#x02009;mol&#x02009;dm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), the use of the EC:DMC mixture shows the highest ionic conductivity owing to a synergistic effect: the high-dielectric-constant EC increases the mobile ion number by promoting salt dissociation; the low-viscosity DMC increases the ion mobility by decreasing the solution viscosity. This is why the mixed solvents of EC and linear carbonates are generally adopted in conventional electrolytes of the lithium-ion battery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, when <italic>X</italic><sub>LiFSA</sub> is above 0.14, the solution with DMC as the sole solvent shows an even higher ionic conductivity than that with EC:DMC, which should result from the much lower viscosity of the former at high concentrations. This result suggests that the viscosity becomes the decisive factor on the ionic conductivity for a concentrated solution, wherein intensive ionic association exists independent of the solvents used, showing a distinct departure from the conventional electrolyte design strategy on the basis of dilute concentrations. For the LiFSA/DMC solution, a commercially acceptable ionic conductivity of 1.12&#x02009;mS&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) is obtained even at a &#x02018;super-high' concentration with salt-to-solvent molar ratio of 1:1.1 despite a high viscosity of 238.9&#x02009;mPa&#x02009;s. Although the ionic conductivity is lower than that of the commercial dilute electrolyte, it does not compromise the rate capability of the battery (shown later).</p><p>On the other hand, the drawbacks of the high volatility and high flammability of linear carbonate solvents can be overcome to a large degree owing to the much lower content of organic solvents in the concentrated solutions. Thermogravimetry measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) show that the weight loss of the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC solution is only 1.5&#x02009;wt&#x00025; after elevating the temperature to 100&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which is considerably lower than those of a dilute 1:10.8 LiFSA/DMC solution (65.5&#x02009;wt&#x00025;, corresponding to 1.0&#x02009;mol&#x02009;dm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) and a commercial electrolyte (28.7&#x02009;wt&#x00025;). As demonstrated in the flame tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>), the 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC solution does not burn as fiercely as the commercial dilute electrolyte. The superior thermal stability and flame retardant ability of the concentrated electrolytes contribute to the remarkably improved safety properties as compared with the dilute electrolytes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reversible reaction of a 5&#x02009;V-class electrode</title><p>Anodic dissolution of the Al current collector and/or oxidative decomposition of solvent may be encountered in the high-voltage application of amide-based electrolytes. To exclude the possible influence of the anodic Al dissolution, we initially used platinum foil as the current collector for the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrode in a three-electrode cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The results showed that both dilute (1:10.8) and superconcentrated (1:1.1) LiFSA/DMC electrolytes enabled a reversible Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> de-intercalation/intercalation on the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|Pt electrode, indicating a reasonably good compatibility between the present electrolyte system and LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> material at &#x0223c;5&#x02009;V.</p><p>However, when applied in a coin cell using the conventional Al current collector, low concentrations of LiFSA/DMC electrolytes encountered problems, confirming the critical drawback of anodic Al dissolution for the amide-based electrolytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, the first charge on the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|Al electrode is impossible in the dilute 1:10.8 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte owing to the continuous Al dissolution at 4.3&#x02009;V. In the concentrated 1:1.9 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), the charge/discharge cycling becomes possible up to the cutoff voltage of 4.9&#x02009;V, but the large irreversible capacity indicates the parasitic Al dissolution remains. The Al dissolution subsequently deteriorates the electrical contacts between the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> material and the Al current collector, and results in a fast capacity decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Actually, the poor cycling performance on the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrode was generally observed in other concentrated 1:2 LiFSA/carbonate ester electrolytes, such as LiFSA in EC, propylene carbonate (PC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), indicating this concentration is not sufficient to fully inhibit Al dissolution at 5&#x02009;V.</p><p>In contrast, the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte enables a reversible Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> de-intercalation/intercalation reaction on the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrode even at a high voltage of 5.2&#x02009;V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In a charge/discharge cycling test, the capacity retention after 100 cycles was over 95&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), and the coulombic efficiency was close to 100&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), evidencing an effective inhibition of anodic Al dissolution. Similarly, using the super-high concentration of 1:1.3, all the LiFSA/carbonate electrolytes enabled stable charging/discharging cycling of the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrode (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> for example). Especially, the electrolytes using low-dielectric-constant and low-viscosity linear carbonate solvents (for example, DMC, EMC and DEC) showed a faster rate capability as compared with those using high-dielectric-constant and high-viscosity cyclic carbonate solvents (for example, EC, PC and their corresponding mixtures), which is at least partly owing to the much higher ionic conductivity of the former. These results demonstrate that the salt-superconcentrated strategy is a simple, effective and fruitful approach to various safe and stable high-voltage electrolytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that stable and fast charge/discharge cycling of a 5&#x02009;V-class electrode using amide salt-based organic electrolytes has been achieved.</p><p>The progressive inhibition of anodic Al dissolution with increasing salt concentration is further proved by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of an Al electrode and the subsequent scanning electron microscopy observation on the polarized Al surface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> for details). This notable concentration effect was recently reported but with a debate on whether a stable surface film on Al (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) or the elimination of uncoordinated (free) solvents of electrolyte<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> plays the key role. We conducted a surface analysis of the Al electrodes polarized in various concentrations of LiFSA/DMC electrolytes by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) as well as a comparative LSV study between fresh and polarized Al electrodes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref> for details). We were unable to obtain any essential evidence to support the existence of a stronger surface film generated in the concentrated electrolyte. Instead, we found that the LiFSA salt readily decomposes and produces LiF upon Ar<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> etching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The previous observation in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02014;a much thicker surface film of LiF produced in a higher concentration of electrolyte&#x02014;is likely to arise from the decomposition of un-rinsed amide salt induced by Ar<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> etching in the XPS measurement.</p><p>We now study the solution structure of the electrolytes using Raman spectroscopy observation and density functional theory molecular dynamics simulation (DFT-MD). As shown in the Raman spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> left), a free DMC molecule exhibits an O-CH<sub>3</sub> stretching vibration band at 910&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This band shifts up to 930&#x02013;935&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> when DMC participates in Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solvation. In dilute 1:10.8 LiFSA/DMC, the majority of DMC molecules exist in a free state because the solvent-to-salt molar ratio (10.8) is much larger than a typical four- or fivefold coordination of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in aprotic solvents. As the LiFSA concentration increases, the population of free DMC decreases and that of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinated DMC increases; the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> association simultaneously intensifies through the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs, FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> coordinating to one Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and aggregate clusters (AGGs, FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> coordinating to two or more Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). The latter is evidenced from a remarkable upshift of the FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> band (700&#x02013;780&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> right), which is typically observed in the amide-based concentrated solutions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. For the moderately concentrated 1:2 LiFSA/DMC solution, the Raman band corresponding to free DMC is remarkably weakened, suggesting that the majority of DMC are solvating to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. This is consistent with the DFT-MD simulation, which shows ca. 90&#x00025; DMC are coordinating to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> with the rest as free solvent (marked as light blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, the simulation illustrates that all FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions are coordinating to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> with ca. 20&#x00025; as CIPs and ca. 80&#x00025; as AGGs (marked as orange and dark blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, respectively). The coordination environment is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>. For the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC solution, both DMC and FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> bands further upshift substantially, indicating both Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-DMC and Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> interactions enhanced compared with those in 1:2 LiFSA/DMC. The DFT-MD simulation reveals that all DMC molecules, together with all FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions, are coordinating to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (no free solvent or anion). Interestingly, besides oxygen, significant amount of nitrogen on FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions also participate in the coordination with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, which is hardly observed at the lower concentrations. The contribution of nitrogen coordinating to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. More importantly, almost all FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions remain in AGG states during the whole DFT-MD simulation time (0.1&#x02009;fs &#x000d7; 100,000 steps), and a CIP state is rarely observed, demonstrating the unusual solution structural feature with AGG clusters as the predominant components in the superconcentrated LiFSA/DMC solution. It is noteworthy that each FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion coordinates to 2&#x02013;3 Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and each Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is coordinated by 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC. Hence, FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions in the superconcentrated solution connect with each other through the intensive association with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, leading to a reinforced three-dimensional network (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This feature is different from the less concentrated solutions, wherein significant amount of CIPs and free solvents divide the solution structure into relatively small-size parts.</p><p>Generally, the anodic metal dissolution requires three steps: first, oxidation of the metal to a metal cation; second, coordination of the metal cation by solvents or anions; and finally, the diffusion of the solvated metal cation to the bulk electrolyte<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. At high voltages of &#x0223c;5&#x02009;V, the first step proceeds more rapidly and extensively than at the conventional operating voltage of 4&#x02009;V. Thereby, the subsequent coordination and diffusion must be strongly inhibited by the nature of electrolyte solutions to suppress the metal ion dissolution. In the moderately concentrated 1:2 LiFSA/carbonate electrolytes, the presence of significant free solvents and CIPs (with two or more coordination sites remaining vacant) could coordinate to Al cations and fail to inhibit Al dissolution completely at 5&#x02009;V. In contrast, the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte effectively inhibits Al dissolution even over 5&#x02009;V, which can be ascribed to its peculiar AGGs-predominant solution structure: (i) all DMC solvents and all FSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions strongly coordinate to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cations and thus have a much lower probability of coordinating to other metal cations; (ii) the resulting reinforced three-dimensional network further retards the diffusion rate of the metal cations, particularly, those with multiple charge.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stable cycling of a 4.6&#x02009;V LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|graphite battery</title><p>In addition to the excellent performance achieved on the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-positive electrode, the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte also realized ultra-stable charge/discharge cycling on the natural graphite-negative electrode despite the absence of conventional SEI-forming agent of EC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>): the application in a graphite|Li half-cell exhibits a capacity retention of 99.6&#x00025; after 100 cycles with coulombic efficiency of &#x0223c;99.8&#x00025;, and with rate capability comparable with that using a commercial dilute electrolyte. Accordingly, the superconcentrated electrolyte was further applied in the high-voltage LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|graphite full cell, a much harsher condition than in the half-cell, because the active lithium resource is limited and a new underlying problem arises from the transition metal dissolution from the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> especially at high voltages and elevated temperatures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a,b</xref> shows charge/discharge voltage profiles of LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|natural graphite full cells at 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C using a state-of-the-art commercial electrolyte and the lab-made superconcentrated electrolyte, respectively. The cell with the commercial electrolyte suffers from a severe capacity decay during cycling, that is, only 18&#x00025; of the initial capacity left after 100 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In contrast, the capacity retention using the 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte is over 90&#x00025; after 100 cycles, exhibiting a remarkably improved cycling durability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10 and 11</xref>). Notably, the superiority of the superconcentrated electrolyte becomes even more marked at 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). It is generally accepted that the poor cycling performance of the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>|graphite battery originates from the dissolution of transition metals from LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> into the electrolyte, as introduced at the beginning of this article. Indeed, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) observation shows a much lower content of Mn and Ni on the graphite electrode of the full cell cycled in the superconcentrated electrolyte than that in the commercial electrolyte, which provides evidence for the effective inhibition of transition metal dissolution in the former. There are two main reasons for the improved performance: (i) LiFSA is less reactive to produce HF as compared with LiPF<sub>6</sub>, which alleviates the corrosion of LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and, thus, reduces the formation of soluble Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; (ii) even if some Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are formed on the surface of LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, they can hardly dissolve in and transport through the AGGs-predominant superconcentrated electrolyte owing to the same functional manner for the inhibition of Al dissolution. Moreover, it is worth noting that the rate performance of the full cell using the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC is comparable with that using the commercial electrolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), although the former shows an ionic conductivity one-order lower than the latter. The mechanistic understanding on the high-rate capability of the superconcentrated electrolyte is underway in our laboratory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that, an electrolyte with such an ultra-simple formulation&#x02014;a single salt and a single solvent without any additive&#x02014;realizes stable cycling of a high-voltage lithium-ion battery.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The conventional dilute LiPF<sub>6</sub>/EC-based electrolytes have dominated the electrolyte market of 4&#x02009;V-class lithium-ion batteries over the past 25 years; however, they show difficulties in satisfying the requirements of next-generation 5&#x02009;V-class batteries in terms of both safety and stability. Our work demonstrates a number of electrolytes with a reinforced three-dimensional network that are obtained by simple mixing of a stable salt with a conventional carbonate solvent at &#x02018;super-high' concentrations. Owing to its peculiar structural characteristics, the superconcentrated electrolytes overcomes the longstanding challenge faced by the unstable LiPF<sub>6</sub>-based electrolytes at high voltages (passivating the Al current collector versus accelerating the transition metal dissolution of the active material), thus, enables a stable operation of a 5&#x02009;V-class battery. Emphasis is on the fact that the peculiar solution structure and functionalities are unique to such super-high concentrations (solvent/salt&#x02248;1.1), and cannot be achieved in moderately high concentrations (solvent/salt&#x0003e;1.8) as in previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Besides the positive electrode side, the superconcentrated electrolytes also show a good compatibility with the natural graphite-negative electrode even in the absence of EC. It breaks through the limitation of a general requirement of EC for a SEI formation for a lithium-ion electrolyte, and diversifies the electrolyte formulation towards various EC-free electrolytes. Different from the conventional electrolyte design that requires a high-dielectric-constant (usually high-viscosity) solvent, the superconcentrated electrolyte prefers a low-viscosity solvent. Although the ionic conductivity of the superconcentrated electrolyte is lower than that of the conventional dilute electrolyte, it does not necessarily compromise the rate capability of the battery. Clarification of the corresponding mechanism would be enlightening for developing novel high-power batteries. Furthermore, the superconcentrated electrolytes show superior thermal stability and flame retardant ability, alleviating the safety risk for a high-voltage battery using conventional dilute electrolytes. Finally, it is noteworthy that our reported superconcentrated electrolytes do not contain any additives, signifying the potential to further enhance the performance. These desirable features above outperform the conventional dilute electrolytes; meanwhile, the wide-temperature window of the liquid state (ensuring a good contact with the electrode materials), as well as the convenience of the approach, surpass the solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, the superconcentrated electrolytes might offer opportunities to build safe and stable high-voltage batteries that are not limited to the lithium-ion.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Preparation of electrolytes and electrodes</title><p>LiFSA (Nippon shokubai) and all solvents (DMC, DEC, EMC, EC and PC, Kishida Chemical Co.
