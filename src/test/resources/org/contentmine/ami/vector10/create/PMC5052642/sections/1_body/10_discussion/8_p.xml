<p>Comparing the magnitudes of the displacement fields along the different directions, we find that the electrode expands âˆ¼25 times more in the TP direction as compared with the IP directions. As the expansion mostly stems from spherical polycrystalline silicon particles with isotropic lithiation properties, this anisotropy can only be explained by the cell housing confinement, which limits expansion along the IP directions.</p>
