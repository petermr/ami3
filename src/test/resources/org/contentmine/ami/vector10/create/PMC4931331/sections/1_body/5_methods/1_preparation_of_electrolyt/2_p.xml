 <sup>−2</sup> with a thickness of ∼15–20 μm, unless otherwise mentioned. The use of relatively low mass loading was to spotlight the critical issue of anodic Al dissolution as the content ratio of metallic Al components (Al current collector and Al positive cap) to the active electrode material becomes much higher in a coin cell. Nevertheless, thick electrodes with a high mass loading of ∼10 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> were also tested. The results are shown in
