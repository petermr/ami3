  <title>SiC-free graphene growth on Si NPs.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) A low-magnification TEM image of Gr–Si NP. (
   <bold>b</bold>) A higher-magnification TEM image for the same Gr–Si NP from the white box in 
   <bold>a</bold>. (Insets) The line profiles from the two red boxes indicate that the interlayer spacing between graphene layers is ∼3.4 Å, in good agreement with that of typical graphene layers based on van der Waals interaction. (
   <bold>c</bold>) A high-magnification TEM image visualizing the origins (red arrows) from which individual graphene layers grow. (
   <bold>d</bold>) A schematic illustration showing the sliding process of the graphene coating layers that can buffer the volume expansion of Si.
