  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) The pellet conductivities of Gr–Si, AC–Si and Super P–Si at different carbon contents. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The first lithiation–delithiation profiles. The electrode thicknesses of 5 wt%-Gr–Si, 1 wt%-Gr–Si, 2 wt%-AC–Si and pristine Si (Super P 1 wt%) are 4.5, 5.0, 8.3 and 12.3 μm, respectively. (
   <bold>c</bold>) The lithiation (filled circle) and delithiation (open circle) capacity retentions of the same four samples. The potential was swept within a voltage window between 0.01 and 1.5 V at 0.5C. (
   <bold>d</bold>) The top-viewed SEM images: the 5 wt%-Gr–Si electrode (left) before and (middle) after 200 cycles and (right) the 2 wt%-AC–Si electrode after 200 cycles. (
   <bold>e</bold>) A high-magnification TEM image of 5 wt%-Gr–Si after 200 cycles obtained from the white box in the low-magnification TEM image (top inset). Middle inset: selected area electron diffraction showing amorphous nature of Si after cycling. Bottom inset: a line profile from the graphene layers in the red box displaying an interlayer distance of 3.8 Å. (
   <bold>f</bold>) Rate capability of 5 wt%-Gr–Si with different initial areal capacities (3.0, 2.0 and 1.0 mAh cm
   <sup>−2</sup>).
