The particle mesh Ewald method was used for long-range electrostatic interaction and the cutoff distance for nonbonding interaction was set to be 10 Å. The solution system was first energy-minimized with the steepest descent method and the conjugate gradient method before running equilibrium MD simulations. Subsequently, a constant
