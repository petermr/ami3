<p>An iridium layer with a thickness of 40 nm was deposited on a silica disk using sputter deposition and EB-PVD. Graphene was grown by CVD on the iridium surface in a methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>)/hydrogen (H
 <sub>2</sub>) mixture at 1,000 °C (refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). To eliminate impurities during the CVD graphene growth, the iridium surface was annealed at 1,000 °C with H
 <sub>2</sub> gas before the introduction of the CH
 <sub>4</sub>/H
 <sub>2</sub> mixture for the graphene formation.
