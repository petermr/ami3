 <caption> Performance of fabricated PSCs–LIB and PS-LIB. ( a) Voltage–time ( V– t) curves of the PSCs–LIB device (blue and black lines at the 1st–10th cycles: charged at 0.5 C using PSC and galvanostatically discharged at 0.5 C using power supply. Red and black lines at the 11th–15th cycles: both galvanostatically charged and discharged at 0.5 C using power supply). ( b) J– V curves, ( c) V oc and J c, ( d) fill factor (FF) and solar-to-electric PCE ( η 1) of the connected PSCs before and after various cycles. ( e) Discharge capacity (Note, a slight variation was observed for the discharge duration at different cycle numbers), ( f) overall photo-electric conversion efficiency of the PSCs–LIB device ( η 2) and ( g) energy storage (conversion) efficiency ( η 3) of LIB, as a function of the cycle number. </caption>
