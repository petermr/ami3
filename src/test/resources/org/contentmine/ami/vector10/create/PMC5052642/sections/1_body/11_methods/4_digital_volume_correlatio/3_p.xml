<p>For the silicon/graphite-lithium sample the DVC spatial resolution was pushed to the limit in order to resolve the highly inhomogeneous expansion characteristics stemming from the combination of graphite with silicon: 3 passes with 208 voxel window size, 48 voxel peak search radius, 8 × 8 × 8 binning, 50% overlap; 4 passes with 80 voxel window size, 20 voxel peak search radius, 4 × 4 × 4 binning, 50% overlap and 5 passes with 32 voxel window size, 10 voxel peak search radius, 2 × 2 × 2 binning, 50% overlap. No Gaussian filter was applied to the computed fields. All other settings remained the same.</p>
