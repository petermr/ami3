<p>In this work, we report an electrolyte system to resolve the dilemma. We select stable yet dissociative lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSA) as the salt and oxidation-stable carbonate esters as the solvent. We demonstrate an unusual liquid with a peculiar three-dimensional structural network obtained at extremely high salt concentrations. The superconcentrated electrolyte not only effectively suppresses the anodic Al dissolution but also remarkably inhibits the transition metal dissolution and, thus, realizes a safe, stable and fast-rate high-voltage LiNi
