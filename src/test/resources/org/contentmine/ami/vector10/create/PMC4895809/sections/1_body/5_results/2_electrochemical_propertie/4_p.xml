<p>Full cells with the commercial LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> as the cathode and electrochemically activated nanocomposites (CNE, CCNE or CNNE) as the anode are fabricated to evaluate the battery performance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7b</xref> shows the cycling performance of these coin-type full cells. The working voltage of the full cells ranges from 2.4 to 3.6 V, and the current density is 15 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Based on the grid substrates, the CNE/LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> cell delivers an initial discharge capacity of 141 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (the reversible capacity of LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> is 155 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> when it is cycled between 3 and 4.4 V versus Li metal). The capacity fades to 136 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 100 cycles, with 96.4% capacity retention. Comparatively, the CCNE/LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> and CNNE/LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> cells show slightly increased reversible capacities and more stable cycle performance. However, there is no obvious difference among the capacities of the full cells. This result is due to the cathode-limited design, in which the cell utilizes under stable conditions only a fraction of the capacity offered by the anode, with the cell capacity balance leading to optimal cell behaviour
