<p>Despite that the ultrafast chemical exchange dynamics between free DEC and Li–DEC complex was observed in pure DEC solutions, typical LIB's use mixed solvents instead. To elucidate the separate roles and solvation properties of co-solvents with DMC and PC and to investigate the possibility of DMC playing dual roles both as a solvent medium for mobile Li–PC(DMC) complexes and as a ligand participating in the first solvation shell around Li
 <sup>+</sup>, we carried out 2D infrared chemical exchange measurements for LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> solutions in the more realistic DMC and PC mixed solvents, which are (i) 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in DMC:PC (1:1 in volume percent) solution, (ii) 1.5 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in DMC:PC (1.5:1) solution and (iii) 2.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in DMC:PC (1.5:1) solution. Here it should be noted that we considered DMC:PC mixed solvents instead of DEC:PC mixed solvents because of the following reasons. First, since the C=O stretching vibrational lifetime of DMC is comparatively longer than that of DEC, we could observe measurable diagonal and cross peaks of free DMC and Li–DMC complex in our 2D infrared spectra at long waiting times. Second, we here show that the chemical exchanges observed in Li–DEC (single carbonate solvent) solution do occur in different mixed solvent systems too.
