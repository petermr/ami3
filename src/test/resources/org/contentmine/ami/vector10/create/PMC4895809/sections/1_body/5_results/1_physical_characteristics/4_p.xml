<p>The structure and chemical composition of all samples are further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>. The XRD results indicate that the obtained copper oxides nanowires have a monoclinic structure, and a weak peak at 26.2° corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite-like carbon nitrides. The Raman results also confirm the single-phase property and high crystallinity of CuO nanowires, while in the CCNE and CNNE samples, two intense bands at 1355 and 1593, cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the D-band (disorder-induced phonon mode) and G-band (graphite band) of carbon nitrides, respectively

 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> can be used to estimate the degree of disorder in carbon materials
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Note that the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio of the CNNE is higher than that of the CCNE, indicating that the thermal reduction process generates extrinsic defects in the carbon-nitride framework. The FT-IR analysis reveals the oxidation of Cu

 </sub> film. The XPS analysis provides further evidence for the significant chemical nature of nitrogen incorporation in the carbon matrix. In the N spectrum, the peak shows an asymmetry, where the major component at 398.7 eV is due to the pyridinic nitrogen, and shoulder peaks at 400.1−401.2 eV are assigned to the pyrrolic nitrogen in the terminal C−N groups and quaternary nitrogen in the graphite C−N bonds

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This finding indicates that the nitrogen-substituted carbon creates more pyridine- and pyrrole-like defects in the carbon framework and generates more active sites for the Li storage. Due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen (3.5) than carbon (3.0), and its smaller diameter, the stronger interaction between the carbon nitrides and Li also facilitates the penetration of Li across the defects
