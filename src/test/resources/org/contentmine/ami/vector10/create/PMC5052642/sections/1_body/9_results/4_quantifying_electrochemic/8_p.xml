<p>We now show how DVC-based analysis of volumetric strain can provide insights into electrochemical behaviour. Our analysis leads to two observations: (i) lithiation starts at the electrode–separator interfaces and progresses towards the current collectors and (ii) SOC gradients build-up immediately in the delithiating electrode, while they develop only during the second half of the experiment in the lithiating electrode. The first observation is consistent with our understanding from literature that lithiation kinetics within graphite electrodes are limited by ionic diffusion and conductivity rather than by electric conductivity

 <italic>operando</italic> experiment, the top electrode will behave similarly to the delithiation curve (black line), while the bottom electrode will behave as the lithiation curve (red line). The larger average slope of the lithiation curve implies that overpotentials developing along the TP direction will induce only smaller SOC gradients within the lithiating bottom electrode, while the smaller slope of the delithiation curve suggests that overpotentials can trigger larger SOC variations within the delithiating top electrode. From the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique protocol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, inset) used during the experiment, we estimate the overpotential to be approximately 20 mV, or equivalently ΔΦ=10 mV per electrode. According to the calculated slopes, this can lead to SOC variations of

 </inline-formula> within the top electrode during the first half of the experiment, while the expected SOC variation within the bottom electrode is below 1 %. Only in the second half of the experiment corresponding to the flat regime of the lithiation curve, can gradients also develop in the bottom electrode. The agreement between the expected behaviour of graphite during (de)lithiation and our observations in tomography indicate that for low attenuation contrast and small volume expansion materials such as graphite, DVC is a robust method for tracking small changes in microstructure that can be correlated to electrochemical activity.
