 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> is one of the simplest available techniques. Although paganin phase contrast (PPC) is fully quantitative only if (i) the sample consists of a single homogeneous material phase and a void phase and (ii) the ratio

 <italic>β</italic> of the real and the imaginary parts of the material's X-ray refractive index is known, it has been applied to multiphase samples, including weakly attenuating lithium dendrites

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and lithium sulphur electrodes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In this case,

 <italic>β</italic> can be considered a tuneable imaging parameter that determines the degree to which the phase is retrieved.
