 <caption> Cycling performance of the LTO, LFPO and LFPO–LTO. ( a) V– t curves of a fresh LFPO–LTO cell measured at 0.5 C in the voltage range of 1.0–2.6 V for 15 cycles. ( b) Cycling performance of LTO, LFPO and LFPO–LTO cells measured at 0.5 C in the voltage ranges of 1.0–3.0, 2.5–4.0 and 1.0–2.6 V, respectively, for 30 cycles. ( c) Conversion efficiency ( η 3) and Coulombic efficiency of LFPO–LTO for 30 cycles. </caption>
