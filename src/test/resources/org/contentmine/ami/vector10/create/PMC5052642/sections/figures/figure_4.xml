  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Left: sketch of a cylindrically-shaped observation volume within the bottom electrode in the initial time step. Middle: vector field representing the displacements within this volume between the first and the last time steps. The IP and TP vector field components have been rescaled for better visibility. Right: dynamic volume in the last time step resulting from warping the initial red volume with the displacement field. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Electrode volume, particle volume and porosity as a function of charge as determined from the dynamic volumes. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Tortuosities along the two IP and the TP direction as a function of specific charge. The right axis refers to their change relative to the initial value.
