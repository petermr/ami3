  <inline-graphic id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms12693-i1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>Electrochemical processes strongly depend on the wetting and mobility phenomena at the involved nano-confined interfaces. Here, the authors use a surface forces apparatus to understand the wetting behavior of graphene, gold, and mica surfaces by Li-ion battery electrolytes.
