<p>In summary, we demonstrated that a combination of 
 <italic>operando</italic> X-ray tomographic microscopy, PPC, and DVC enables the analysis of the lithiation dynamics and microstructural evolution occurring in LIB electrodes during cycling, thereby guiding the design of next-generation battery electrodes. We validated this combination of techniques on graphite electrodes, which are perhaps the most challenging of all LIB electrodes for X-ray imaging because of the weak attenuation of graphite. We then applied the same set of techniques to study a silicon-graphite composite electrode during the course of lithiation. Our results highlight that DVC can be applied to spatially resolve deformation and electrochemical activity in various types of electrodes. It is suitable for electrodes with Li(Ni

Furthermore, our results show that DVC can be used to obtain the dynamic volumes needed for realistic modelling and simulation of 3D electrode microstructures, as well as accurate calculation of microstructural parameters such as porosity and tortuosity as a function of electrode SOC. Quantifying the microstructural changes occurring in an electrode during (de)lithiation enabled us to gain insight into how lithium transport is influenced by the dynamic microstructure. As our results for a SiC composite electrode indicate, this will be a key factor influencing the performance and longevity of next-generation lithium ion battery composite anodes consisting of both, intercalation and alloying compounds.
