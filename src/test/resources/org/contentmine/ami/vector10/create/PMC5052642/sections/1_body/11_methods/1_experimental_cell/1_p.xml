<p>An electrochemical cell for 
 <italic>operando</italic> XTM measurements was designed. The battery can consist of two arbitrary electrodes and a separator placed between two stainless steel current collectors. The upper current collector is connected to a spring loaded electrically conductive probe pin, which accommodates for volumetric changes of the electrodes during operation and guarantees a well-defined pressure in TP direction and good electric contact at all times. This pressure is calculated to be approximately 50 N cm
 <sup>−2</sup>; a typical value for an experimental electrochemical cell
