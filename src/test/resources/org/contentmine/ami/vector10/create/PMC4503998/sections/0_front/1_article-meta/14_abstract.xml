 <p>An innovative and environmentally friendly battery chemistry is proposed for high power applications. A carbon-coated ZnFe
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> nanoparticle-based anode and a LiFePO
  <sub>4</sub>-multiwalled carbon nanotube-based cathode, both aqueous processed with Na-carboxymethyl cellulose, are combined, for the first time, in a Li-ion full cell with exceptional electrochemical performance. Such novel battery shows remarkable rate capabilities, delivering 50% of its nominal capacity at currents corresponding to ≈20C (with respect to the limiting cathode). Furthermore, the pre-lithiation of the negative electrode offers the possibility of tuning the cell potential and, therefore, achieving remarkable gravimetric energy and power density values of 202 Wh kg
  <sup>−1</sup> and 3.72 W kg
  <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, in addition to grant a lithium reservoir. The high reversibility of the system enables sustaining more than 10 000 cycles at elevated C-rates (≈10C with respect to the LiFePO
  <sub>4</sub> cathode), while retaining up to 85% of its initial capacity.
