<p>Here, different types of ZFO/LFP-CNT lithium-ion cells are presented with an average ZFO/LFP active mass ratio of 0.67. Despite the oversized cathode, the substantially lower specific capacity of LFP results in a positive to negative capacity ratio of ≈0.22 (calculated according to the practical capacities of the two active materials, i.e., about 160 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> for LFP, obtained at the 10
 <sup>th</sup> cycle at C/5; and 1070 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> for ZFO, obtained at the 20
 <sup>th</sup> cycle at C/10). Hence, the LFP-CNT cathodes in principle limit the capacity of all cells. Overall, three kinds of full-cells were assembled with fresh LFP-CNT cathodes and pre-formed ZFO anodes. With respect to the lithiation degree of the negative electrode, the cells are labeled as follows: “ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT” (fully de-lithiated anode), “ZFO-200/LFP-CNT” (anode doped with 200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and “ZFO-600/LFP-CNT” (anode doped with 600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Although the doping leads to increased positive to negative capacity ratios (ZFO-200 and ZFO-600 have a practical capacity of ≈870 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 470 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively), this remains considerably lower than the unity (i.e., 0.28 and 0.51 for ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively) and, therefore, all devices are still cathode limited. The performances of this novel type of battery have been investigated by galvanostatic cycling with current densities ranging from 0.05 to 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Given the different capacities and active material mass loadings of the individual electrodes, the current effectively applied to the cells are also reported in A g
 <sup>−1</sup> and C-rate with respect to both anode and cathode (see
