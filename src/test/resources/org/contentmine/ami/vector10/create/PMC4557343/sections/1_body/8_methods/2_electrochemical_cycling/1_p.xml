<p>The electrochemical cycling of layered-LNMO particles were conducted using coin cells configuration with metallic Li as counter electrode, separator of Celgard K1640 monolayer polyethylene membrane, with 1:2 volume ratio, 1 M Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in ethyl carbonate and Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte in an argon-filled MBraun glovebox. The 45-cycle sample studied in this work was cycled at a rate of 0.1 C between 2.0–4.7 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at room temperature. The first cycle charge/discharge profile and ‘charge and discharge' capacities as function of cycle numbers at 2.0–4.7 V versus Li/Li+ are given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>. The cycled coin cells were disassembled and the cycled electrode was immersed in DMC for 12 h followed by washing by DMC for three times. The washed electrodes were dried in vacuum for 12 h. The cathode material was removed from the Al-foil and grounded to fine powders and deposited on a lacey carbon TEM grid for TEM imaging. The nanoparticles for APT specimens were lifted out from the TEM grid using lift-out method described below.
