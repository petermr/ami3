<p>Similar to the Li-alloying process, the conversion reaction leads to volume variation on electrochemical cycling. Therefore, pure metal oxide electrodes typically suffer from poor cyclability and poor power capability. To solve these issues, researchers have tried various strategies such as reducing particle size or using nanocomposites

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Reducing particle size is considered as an effective approach to reduce volume variation. Indeed, many nanostructures based on 3d metal oxides, such as nanospheres, nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, nanoplates, and hollow structures, have been summarized in a wealth of published articles
