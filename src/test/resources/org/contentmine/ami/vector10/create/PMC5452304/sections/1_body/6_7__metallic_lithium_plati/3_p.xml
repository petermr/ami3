<p>The formed metallic lithium deposits on the graphite anode are affected by the degree of random orientation of the particles in the crystal structure in the anode material and the non-uniformity of the current distribution which is a function of diffusion and current density [

 <xref rid="B85-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The disorientation of the particles in the graphite electrode initiates inhomogeneity in the charge distribution on the anode electrode in the third and fourth intercalation stages and results in the formation of moss-like deposits and dendrites [

 <xref rid="B87-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. These moss-like deposits and dendrites grow as a function of the temperature and current density between the polymer separator and the anode. As the temperature and charge rate increases, the reaction rate also increases and metallic lithium is deposited on the graphite at overcharge. Dendrites can cause the separator to disconnect and become isolated from the electrolyte and in some instances pierce through the separator. The mat of dead lithium and dendrites can cause a short circuit and thermal runway in the battery (e.g.,
