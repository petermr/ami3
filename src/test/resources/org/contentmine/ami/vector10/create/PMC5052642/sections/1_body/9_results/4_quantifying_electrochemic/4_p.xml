<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, we map out the volumetric strain distributions within the electrodes as a function of the SOC by correlating the scans at the different SOCs with the 0% SOC scan. The maps indicate that the top electrode (top row) is gradually contracting while the bottom electrode (row in the middle) is expanding. From the vertical cuts (bottom row), it is evident that, up to 48% SOC, volumetric strains occur rather homogeneously in all parts of the lithiating bottom electrode, while at &gt;50% SOC, ‘strain fronts' progress from the electrode-separator interfaces towards the bottom current collector. On the contrary, the delithiating top electrode shows inhomogeneous contraction behaviour, where multiple ‘strain fronts' subsequently progress from the separator–electrode interface towards the top current collector.
