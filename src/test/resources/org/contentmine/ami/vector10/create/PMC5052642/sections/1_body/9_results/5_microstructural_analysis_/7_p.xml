<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, we plot the relative volumetric changes of the dynamic observation window and of the active graphite particles as a function of the flowed specific charge. The overall electrode expands by almost 7% (blue curve), consistent with our findings in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, and the particles (black curve in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) expand by more than 10%, in excellent agreement with literature where it is reported that the crystal lattice of graphite expands predominantly along its 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis direction by approximately 10.5% on a full lithiation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The porosity (red curve) first slightly decreases from 48 to 46%, but then remains at 46% for the second half of the lithiation because the particles expand more than the overall electrode only during the first half of lithiation.
