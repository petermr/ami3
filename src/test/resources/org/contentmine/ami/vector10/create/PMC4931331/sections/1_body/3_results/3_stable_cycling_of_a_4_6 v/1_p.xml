<p>In addition to the excellent performance achieved on the LiNi

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>): the application in a graphite|Li half-cell exhibits a capacity retention of 99.6% after 100 cycles with coulombic efficiency of ∼99.8%, and with rate capability comparable with that using a commercial dilute electrolyte. Accordingly, the superconcentrated electrolyte was further applied in the high-voltage LiNi

The cell with the commercial electrolyte suffers from a severe capacity decay during cycling, that is, only 18% of the initial capacity left after 100 cycles (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10 and 11</xref>). Notably, the superiority of the superconcentrated electrolyte becomes even more marked at 55 °C (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). It is generally accepted that the poor cycling performance of the LiNi

 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> into the electrolyte, as introduced at the beginning of this article. Indeed, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) observation shows a much lower content of Mn and Ni on the graphite electrode of the full cell cycled in the superconcentrated electrolyte than that in the commercial electrolyte, which provides evidence for the effective inhibition of transition metal dissolution in the former. There are two main reasons for the improved performance: (i) LiFSA is less reactive to produce HF as compared with LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>, which alleviates the corrosion of LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and, thus, reduces the formation of soluble Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>; (ii) even if some Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> are formed on the surface of LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, they can hardly dissolve in and transport through the AGGs-predominant superconcentrated electrolyte owing to the same functional manner for the inhibition of Al dissolution. Moreover, it is worth noting that the rate performance of the full cell using the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC is comparable with that using the commercial electrolyte (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), although the former shows an ionic conductivity one-order lower than the latter. The mechanistic understanding on the high-rate capability of the superconcentrated electrolyte is underway in our laboratory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that, an electrolyte with such an ultra-simple formulation—a single salt and a single solvent without any additive—realizes stable cycling of a high-voltage lithium-ion battery.
