<p>Commercially available copper foils (99.9% purity, 0.1 mm thick), copper grids (99.9% purity, 600 mesh) and copper nets (99.9% purity, 600 mesh) were used as the starting substrates to synthesize 3D CuO nanosubstrates through a vapor-phase approach
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In a typical procedure, copper substrates were cleaned in an aqueous 1.0 M HCl solution for 10 min, followed by repeated rinsing with distilled water. After they had been dried under a N
 <sub>2</sub> gas flow, they were immediately heated to 600 °C for 5 h under an oxygen atmosphere in a tubular electrical furnace. In addition, CuO nanowires of similar quality were grown on the surfaces of all these copper substrates.
