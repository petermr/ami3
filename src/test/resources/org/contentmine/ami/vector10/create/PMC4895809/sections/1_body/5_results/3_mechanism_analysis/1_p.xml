<p>The above results demonstrate that the electrode structural design of 3D arrays with core–shell nano-architecture can achieve stable performance in metal oxide anodes. Such a design has multiple advantages: First, the nitrogen-incorporated carbon framework functions as an electrical highway and a Li
 <sup>+</sup> absorbent, so that the CuO/CN
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> nanocables are electrochemically active. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4j</xref> illustrates the micro-mechanism models of the nanocable, where the wire-like CuO core is a bicrystal divided by a (111) twin plane in the direction parallel to the longitudinal axis. Density functional theory calculations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) display surface atomic configurations in (001), (100), (110), (111) and (−111) planes of the CuO unit cell, where the (111) and (−111) planes contain more Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> than other surfaces
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. According to the positive linear relationship between the electrochemical performance of CuO and the redox reaction of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>/Cu
 <sup>0</sup>, the CuO nanowires with more exposed (111) twin planes induce more and faster Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>/Cu
 <sup>0</sup> redox reaction, bringing higher reversible capacity and better rate capability. The (111) twin planes are also much more stable than other planes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, thus exhibiting better cycle performance. Moreover, the microporous CN

 </sub> shell with high nitrogen contents induces numerous pyridine- and pyrrole-like defects, adds Li insertion sites and it thus enhances Li storage capacity. Second, core–shell nano-architecture prevents fracture, where the CuO core is stabilized mechanically by the CN

 </sub> shell. The elastic CN

 </sub> layers are also believed to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus effectively enhance the cycle stability and high rate capability

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8b</xref> shows a single CCNE nanocable lithiated and delithiated five times. During the initial lithiation, snapshots show a progressive lithiation mainly along the axial direction of the nanocable, where the lithiation of CuO nanowire proceeds both axially and radially, but the whole volume of the nanocable shows no evident expansion due to the mechanical buffering effect of microporous CN

  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> shell. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8c</xref> shows the thickness variation of the nanocable during lithiation−delithiation cycles. The CuO core has an evident volume expansion by ∼93% during initial lithiation, but then its dimensions appear to stabilize during the next few cycles. Note that the thickness of the whole shell has no evident change during the cycles, indicating a good structural integrity of the nanocable electrode during electrochemical reactions. Third, 3D arrays with larger surface areas, better permeability and more active sites provide ideal conditions for the facile diffusion of the electrolyte and accommodation of the volumetric strain during electrochemical reactions, thus leading to higher charge transfer efficiency. The nanocable arrays directly grown on current collectors have good adhesion and electrical contact, reduce the path length of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions and electron transfer and enhance the rate capability. Fourth, the monolithic sandwich structure ensures a stable structural integrity, which prevents the electrodes from pulverization and fragmentation. It does not contain additional conductive agents or binders, and this condition improves the energy and power densities of the whole electrode. This structure also enhances the electrical contact with the current collector when it is assembled into cells. In summary, this hierarchical 3D core–shell nanostructure guarantees excellent structural properties and superior electrochemical performance.
