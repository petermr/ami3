<p>Upon graphene growth, the conductivity of the active material assembly becomes markedly enhanced. When pelletized in powder, pristine Si exhibited a low conductivity of &lt;10
 <sup>−7</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, whereas even 1 wt% of graphene addition increased the conductivity remarkably to 12.8 S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This enhancement is ascribed to an excellent percolation behaviour of the graphene coating layers in a way that the 2D graphene and its well-aligned layered stacking promote a well-connected conductive network (

 <sup>−1</sup> for a graphene content of 5 wt%.
