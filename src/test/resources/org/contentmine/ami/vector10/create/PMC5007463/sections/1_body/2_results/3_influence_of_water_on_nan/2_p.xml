<p>As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, following an initial slow variation of the layer thickness, the confined layer thickness on mica remains stable after water injection. On gold, the initially 4.0-nm-thick wetting layer gradually decreases in layer thickness by 8–10 Å. As such, for both mica and gold this indicates slow material transport over tens of seconds. In contrast, on graphene, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, an abrupt drop within 1 s is observed, indicating very fast removal of interfacial species. For graphene, the water injection was additionally performed at different applied pressures, which resulted in different magnitudes of these sudden drops in the layer thickness. The largest decrease (∼2.5 nm) was observed when no additional pressure was applied after restoring the contact at 
 <italic>D</italic>∼5.2 nm by piezo-control. By increasing the pressure, the confined volume was decreased, and the layer shrinkage was reduced to ∼1.6 and ∼0.9 nm, for initial layer thicknesses of 
 <italic>D</italic>∼4.0 and 
 <italic>D</italic>∼3.4 nm, respectively (see again 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Such a decrease in layer thickness can be attributed to the preferred solvation of interfacial ions by water compared with EC/DEC (visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Similar to the interfacial water migration during initial electrolyte injection as described above, the motion of the species forming water solvates after the additional water injection is directed away from the confined area. In this case, the Li ions and the respective counter ions migrate from the confined electrolyte layer to the water phase, causing the layer to shrink. Because of their high mobility, ions are able to swiftly migrate to the water phase outside the contact area. As less mobile lithium/EC layers are present when the pressure is increased, the layer contraction decreases with increasing pressures. Such layering shows similar properties to the slip-planes of confined molecular layers of ionic liquids
