<p>However, it is noted that a DEC molecule has three different sites for electrostatic interaction with Li
 <sup>+</sup>. They are two ester ether oxygen atoms and one carbonyl oxygen atom. Therefore, at least two structures in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> should be considered as possible Li–DEC complexes. Despite that a recent 
 <sup>17</sup>O NMR experiment provided evidence that the ester ether oxygen atoms do not strongly interact with Li-ion
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, it is not entirely clear whether this is the case even at high (1.0 M) lithium salt concentration. To pin point the Li–DEC complex structure among the two in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, quantum chemistry calculations and vibrational analyses of a few complexes were performed with DFT method at the level of B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2pd). For an isolated DEC, the C=O stretch and O−C−O asymmetric stretch frequencies are found to be 1,714.4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1,235.5 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (detailed descriptions on the quantum chemistry calculation results are found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Then, the DFT calculations of two structures in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> show that the C=O···Li
 <sup>+</sup> complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) is more stable by 3.26 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> than the O=C−O···Li
 <sup>+</sup> complex in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>. Furthermore, when Li
 <sup>+</sup> interacts with carbonyl oxygen atom, the C=O stretch frequency is red shifted by 112.2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and simultaneously the O−C−O asymmetric stretch frequency is blue shifted by 62.6 m
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the complex formation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> with two ester ether oxygen atoms of DEC induces strong blue shift (112.4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) of C=O frequency and red shift (96.8 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) of O−C−O asymmetric stretch frequency. These results can be understood by noting that the Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion interacting with carbonyl oxygen atom makes the double bond character (or bond length) of C=O group decrease (increase), which concomitantly makes the C−O bond lengths short (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). When Li
 <sup>+</sup> electrostatically interacts with ester ether oxygen atom, exactly the opposite charge redistribution occurs. Thus, our infrared results are consistent with the previous notion that Li
 <sup>+</sup> preferentially interacts with carbonyl oxygen atom (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In fact, such frequency shifting behaviours of C=O and O−C−O modes in DEC on the formation of C=O···Li
 <sup>+</sup> complex are quite similar to the red and blue shifts of amide I and II modes of peptide bond, respectively, which are mainly C=O stretch and C−N stretch of the peptide bond, respectively, when the amide carbonyl oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. Despite that the quantum chemistry calculations for the two different complex structures in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> are consistent with previous findings and our experimental FT-IR results discussed below, the C=O stretch frequency may depend also on the side chain (ethyl group) conformation. More specifically, the molecular dipole moment of the 
 <italic>cis</italic> conformation can be larger than that of the 
 <italic>trans</italic> conformation so that the 
 <italic>cis</italic> conformer can make a bit stronger interaction with Li
 <sup>+</sup> and form a more stable Li–DEC complex.
