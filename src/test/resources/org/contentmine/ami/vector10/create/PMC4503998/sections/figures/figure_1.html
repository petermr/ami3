 <caption> a) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of LFP-CNT positive electrodes. Inset: the connection network established by CNT between the LiFePO 4 particles. b) Rate capability and coulombic efficiency of LFP-CNT cathodes (in half-cell configuration vs. Li) at C rates ranging from C/5 to 20C. Inset: some selected potential profiles at different current loads. </caption>
