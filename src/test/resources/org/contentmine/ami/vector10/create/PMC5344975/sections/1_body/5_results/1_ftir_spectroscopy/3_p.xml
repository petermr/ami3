<p>The number of solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of a solute molecule is an important quantity providing information on the size and structure of Li-ion solvation sheath. Often, a series of lithium salt concentration-dependent spectroscopic experiments has been used to determine the solvation number around a Li
 <sup>+</sup> in various electrolyte solutions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> showed that the formation of contact ion pair (CIP) between two oppositely charged ions should also be taken into account in quantitatively interpreting the infrared spectra of LIB solutions. That means, the concentration of dissolved LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> is not necessarily identical to the concentration of DEC-solvated Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion because there could exist non-negligible amount of Li

 <sup>−</sup> CIP. Thus, it is necessary to consider three different DEC species that are (i) DEC surrounded by other DECs, (ii) DEC interacting with free Li
 <sup>+</sup> and (iii) DEC interacting with Li

 <sup>−</sup> solvated by DECs or PF

 <sup>−</sup> in CIP imposes yet another complexity to the interpretation of linear and nonlinear infrared spectra. However, because the negatively charged PF

 <sup>−</sup> tends to be away from the carbonate part of DEC due to Coulomb repulsion and preferentially surrounded by the DEC ethyl groups
