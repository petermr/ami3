<p>Another category of treatment on the surface of the anode electrode is the coating of the surface with additives like AD25, AsF

 <xref rid="B96-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Thermal oxidation of graphite in air increases the surface area and fractional edge sites, which increases pores size and reduces particles size [

 <sub>6</sub> stabilize the graphite at elevated temperature and suppress the formation of metallic lithium and reduction products of the LiPF

Lastly, mechanical compression of the graphite particles during the electrode preparation process reduces the pore size thereby reducing the non-homogeneity of the charge distribution on the electrode and improving the reversible and irreversible capacities [
