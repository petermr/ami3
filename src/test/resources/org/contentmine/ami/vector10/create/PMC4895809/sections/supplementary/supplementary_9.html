 <caption> Supplementary Movie 1 In-situ TEM time-lapse movie of a single-sided coating CuO/CN x nanocable during the first lithiation process. Movie shows progressive lithiation mainly along the axial direction of the nanocable and morphological stability during lithiation. Curvature of nanocable is a result of the stable CN x shell resisting the large volume expansion of CuO core. </caption>
