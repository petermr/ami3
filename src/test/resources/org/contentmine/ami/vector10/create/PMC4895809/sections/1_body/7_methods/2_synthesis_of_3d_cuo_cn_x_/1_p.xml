<p>A nanosized CN

  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> film was deposited onto CuO nanosubstrates by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering using a graphite target at 80 W and 1.0 Pa in a N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> Pa to guarantee a clean sputtering condition. The target was pre-sputtered for 15 min to eliminate impurities. The deposition time was set in a stepwise manner to 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min.
