<p>For graphite, none of these three techniques is promising. First, carbon (Z=6) is weakly attenuating for hard X-rays, resulting in low contrast between it and the electrolyte-filled pore space. This in combination with edge enhancement artefacts in such systems renders data binarization particularly challenging. Secondly, even if binarization is possible, the volumetric and attenuation coefficient changes are only 10.5% (refs
