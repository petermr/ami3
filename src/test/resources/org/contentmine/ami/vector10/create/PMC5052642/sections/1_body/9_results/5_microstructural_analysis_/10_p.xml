<p>In summary, for the relatively porous electrode in this cell (designed to keep pressure in order to maintain good electrochemistry, but still accomodating volumetric changes of the sample in the TP direction) lithium transport will not be significantly affected by the reduction in porosity and the narrowing of the pore space (increasing

Different electrode preparation (for example, lower porosity) or cell configurations (for example, wound versus stacked) could result in sections of the electrode that experience significant changes in the microstructure.
