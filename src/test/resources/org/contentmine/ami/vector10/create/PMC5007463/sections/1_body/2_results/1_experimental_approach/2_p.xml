<p>Atomically smooth gold surfaces used in this work were prepared by template stripping from mica. Graphene surfaces were synthesized on smooth iridium layers according to a novel protocol shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>. The graphene-covered disks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) contain a 40-nm iridium layer underneath, which also serves as a semitransparent mirror. Graphene was grown directly on iridium-covered glass disks using the methane/hydrogen chemical vapour deposition (CVD) synthesis route

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and this preparation method will prove useful for many other future SFA experiments. The typical G and two-dimensional (2D) bands in the Raman spectrum of the SFA disks shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref> confirm the presence of graphene on both the EB-PVEDed and sputtered iridium surfaces. The slightly broadened 2D peak indicates double/triple-layer graphene, while the D-band indicates the presence of defects in graphene-deposited iridium. When using the sputtered iridium surface for graphene growth, the very small D-band indicates that the defect density is very low
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The high-quality FECO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and Raman data indicate an excellent quality of graphene SFA disks prepared using this method compared with direct-transfer methods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In this work similar results with identical conclusions were obtained with both graphene topographies (on EB-PVDed and sputtered iridium), although a higher resolution could be obtained using the smoother graphene (see comparison of FECO from rough and smooth graphene surfaces in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).
