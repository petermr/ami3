<p>Ultrafast fluxional changes of Li
 <sup>+</sup> solvation sheath structures in LIB electrolyte solutions are for the first time observed here with employing chemical exchange 2D infrared spectroscopic method. Combining FTIR spectroscopy, infrared pump-probe measurement and quantum chemistry calculation results, we completely characterized the vibrational properties of free DEC and Li–DEC complexes in both pure DEC solvent and mixed solvents consisting of DEC and PC. Subsequent 2D infrared data analyses revealed the ultrafast nature of chemical exchange dynamics in the immediate vicinity of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in DEC solution. Here one of the most difficult challenges was to prepare very thin solution samples because the infrared probes are the C=O stretch modes of DEC and PC molecules that are also solvents. Using RF magnetron sputtering technique, we could control the thickness of coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> layer on CaF
 <sub>2</sub> window for linear and nonlinear infrared spectroscopic studies. The picosecond Li–DEC complex making and breaking dynamics in both pure DEC solution and DMC:PC mixed solution suggest that the macroscopic Li transport during both charging and discharging processes might be interrelated to microscopic solvation fluctuation and discrete transitions between different solvation states of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in LIB electrolyte solutions. We anticipate that the present ultrafast chemical exchange dynamics should also play an important role in solvation and de-solvation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> at the solid-electrolyte interface on electrodes because of the following reason. If the rigidity of each Li
 <sup>+</sup> solvation sheath is very high, any de-solvation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> on the anode surface may not be efficient, which potentially restricts the function of LIB due to lowering the rate of lithium deposition on the anode. On the other hand, if the Li
 <sup>+</sup> solvation sheath is not sufficiently stable due to a low dissolving power of solvent, the rate of Li
 <sup>+</sup> release from the cathode could be slow. Therefore, it is naturally expected that ideal LIB solvent molecules should interact with Li
 <sup>+</sup> with a properly balanced strength. Overall, the unexpected ultrafast fluxional solvation processes around Li
 <sup>+</sup> in the LIB electrolyte solution is turned out to be prerequisite for optimally achieving the functional role of carbonate solvent in LIB. We anticipate that a further 2D infrared investigation on the Li-solvent fluctuation dynamics during both charging and discharging processes would provide critical information on the fluctuation-dissipation relationship between equilibrium microscopic solvent fluctuation and non-equilibrium macroscopic charge transport phenomenon.
