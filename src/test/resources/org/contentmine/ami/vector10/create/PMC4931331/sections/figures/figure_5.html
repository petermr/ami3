 <caption> Performance of a high-voltage LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4|natural graphite battery. Charge–discharge voltage curves of LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4|graphite full cells using ( a) a commercial 1.0 mol dm −3 LiPF 6/EC:DMC (1:1 by vol.) electrolyte and ( b) lab-made superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte at a C/5 rate and 40 °C. The curves of 2nd, 10th, 50th and 100th cycle are shown. ( c) Discharge capacity retention of the full cells at a C/5 rate. The inset shows EDS spectra on the graphite electrode surface (200 × 200 μm 2 area) after 8-day cycling tests, which is equivalent to the operating time of 100 and 20 cycles for the battery using the commercial and superconcentrated electrolytes, respectively. ( d) Discharge capacity of the full cell at various C-rates and 25 °C. All charge-discharge cycling tests were conducted with a cutoff voltage of 3.5–4.8 V. 1C-rate corresponds to 147 mA g −1 on the weight basis of the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4 electrode. </caption>
