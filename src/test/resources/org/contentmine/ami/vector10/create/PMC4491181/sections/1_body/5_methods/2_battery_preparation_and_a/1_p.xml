<p>For the preparation of the battery electrode, slurry was prepared by dispersing active material (Gr–Si/AC–Si) and Li-polyacrylic acid (1.1 M) in a weight ratio of 80:20 in deionized water. The bare Si electrode, a control sample, was prepared by the same procedure, but the electrode components were pristine Si NPs, Super P and 1.1 M Li-polyacrylic acid. The binder content was fixed to 20 wt%, while the contents of pristine Si NPs and Super P were varied from 65 to 79 wt% and from 15 to 1 wt%, respectively. The half-cell was then assembled by using lithium foil as both reference and counter electrodes. Polyethylene membrane (Celgard) and 1.1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>) in ethylene carbonate:diethyl carbonate:fluoroethylene carbonate=2:6:2=v:v:v were used as separator and electrolyte, respectively. The mass loading of the active material ranged from 0.3 to 2.5 mg. The electrochemical properties were characterized under the galvanostatic mode by scanning the potential between 0.01 and 1.5 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at 0.5C except the first cycle at 0.05C. The full cell performance of Gr–Si was characterized by paring with a LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode with a fixed areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The N/P ratio, defined by total capacity ratio between anode and cathode, was chosen to be 1.0–1.1.
