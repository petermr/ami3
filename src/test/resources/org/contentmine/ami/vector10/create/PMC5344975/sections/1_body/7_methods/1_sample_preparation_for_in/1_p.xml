<p>Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>, Battery grade, purity &gt;99.99% trace metal basis) and DEC (purity &gt;99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DEC was dried using thermally activated 3 Å molecular sieves. The water content of the sample determined by Karl-Fisher method was less than 50 p.p.m. All solution electrolyte preparation and injection into the infrared cell holder was carried out in Ar-filled glove box (moisture &lt;1 p.p.m., oxygen &lt;20 p.p.m.). The low water content in sample for infrared absorption measurement was confirmed by examining the water O–H stretch band at around 3,500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the infrared spectra.
