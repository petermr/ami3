 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> we explain the relations between different types of strain and the displacement field. For example, the dynamic shear strain distribution within the electrodes can be used to detect crack formation at the electrode level.
