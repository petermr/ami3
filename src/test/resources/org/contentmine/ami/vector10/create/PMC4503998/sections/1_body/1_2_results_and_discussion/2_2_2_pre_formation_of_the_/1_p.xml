<p>The detailed electrochemical characterization of the herein utilized ZFO-based anodes was already reported previously.
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Such electrodes showed a remarkable rate performance and cycling stability. Being specifically interesting for the application of these electrodes in a lithium-ion full-cell, however, the irreversible charge consumption within the first cycle was slightly less than 30%. This initial irreversible capacity was mainly attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the active material particles surface. Nevertheless, with respect to the anyway limited amount of lithium within a full-cell, the negative electrodes were electrochemically pre-lithiated prior to their assembly in the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-C/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>-CNT lithium-ion full-cells. This pre-lithiation was done by galvanostatic cycling the ZFO anodes in Li half-cells at relatively low current (C/10, i.e., ≈0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>). As displayed in 
 <bold>Figure</bold>
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>, after a slight increase during the initial cycles, ZFO anodes reach a stable reversible capacity of 1073 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at the 20
 <sup>th</sup> cycle. ZFO evenly provides capacity in the potential range from 0 to 2 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. However, it would be desirable to have a negative electrode mainly operating at rather low potentials in order to provide a higher energy density of the final lithium-ion full-cell. This is particularly true when LFP is used as cathode active material, which itself has a relatively low operating potential. Therefore, within the pre-lithiation step, anodes with three different lithiation degrees were prepared as shown in the inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>. Accordingly, within thus processed electrodes a specific capacity of 0 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (ZFO-deLi), 200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (ZFO-200), and 600 (ZFO-600) mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> remained. These two levels of doping have been chosen to investigate the effect of the anode Li storage mechanism on the full cell performance. Indeed, doping the negative electrode with 200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> or 600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> allows to preferentially exploit the conversion mechanism or the alloying mechanism, respectively. The doping of the negative electrodes has, besides the tailoring of the full cell potential, the further function of introducing a Li reservoir into the system, which might buffer eventual irreversible charge consumption processes.
