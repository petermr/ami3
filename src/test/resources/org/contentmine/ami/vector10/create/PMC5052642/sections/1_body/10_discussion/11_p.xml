<p>Finally, we briefly consider the effect of this particle expansion on the microstructure of the SiC electrode. Based on the known chemical composition of the pristine electrode, its mass, its geometric surface area, and its thickness, we estimate (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 8</xref>) of the electrode microstructure in the same three phases (blue numbers). The lithiation of silicon leads to both an expansion of the overall electrode by 35% and a reduction of the porosity by 8%, indicating that, on lithiation, the silicon spreads into the pore space, changing the microstructure, and most likely influencing the lithium transport within the electrodes.
