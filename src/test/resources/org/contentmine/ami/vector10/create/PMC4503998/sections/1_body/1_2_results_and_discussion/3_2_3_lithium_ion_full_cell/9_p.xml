<p>Finally, the effect of the electrochemical studies on the morphology of the ZFO anodes was investigated using SEM. SEM images of pristine and cycled electrodes (with different initial levels of Li doping) are displayed in 
 <bold>Figure</bold>
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>. At a first glance, no dramatic differences can be observed for pristine and cycled electrodes. This somehow confirms the previously mentioned (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>) absence of any particular ageing phenomenon. Nevertheless, a more detailed look reveals some peculiar features appearing on the electrodes cycled at high current rates for 10 000 cycles. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>b, the prolonged operation of ZFO-deLi at potentials above 1 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> (resulting on a main storage of Li through the conversion mechanism) leads to the formation of large agglomerates, which may be responsible for the voltage profile shape change previously mentioned (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>b, left panel). As the anode working potential decreases (in-line with the remaining amount of lithium within the anode after the doping), these clusters become smaller (i.e., ZFO-200, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>c) and practically disappear in ZFO-600 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>d), for which the Li is presumably mostly stored via the alloying mechanism with Zn.
