<p>At higher battery potentials, during the intercalation of lithium ions into the anode lattice structure, the graphite anode oxidizes. At this potential, electrolyte co-solvents, such as EC, which is highly reactive, react with the lithium ions and the reaction products quickly precipitate and grow on the anode surface [

 <xref rid="B14-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The presence of these reaction products on the surface retards the intercalation kinetics of the carbon anode [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The surface layer grows in thickness as the decomposition reaction continues [

 <xref rid="B25-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The layers become unstable and crack due to expansion and contraction of the graphite lattice during the insertion and de-insertion of the lithium ions [

 <xref rid="B26-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The formation of this surface film layer is the predominate source of lithium ion loss in lithium ion battery during storage conditions [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It also leads to an increase in the charge transfer resistance, impedance, and clogs pores on the carbon anode electrode [
