<p>The battery performance was evaluated by galvanostatic cycling of 2025 coin-type cells. The half-cell was made up of nanocomposites as the working electrode and lithium foil as the counter electrode. The full cell was composed of commercial LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> as the cathode and nanocomposites as the anode. The electrolyte was 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in 1:1 ratio by volume of ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate. A Celgard 2400 membrane was employed as the separator. Before assembling the full cells, nanocomposite anodes were electrochemically activated for three cycles in half-cells to eliminate the capacity loss in the first cycle. Being a cathode-limited design, the cell balance value (the capacity ratio of the anode to the cathode) is designed to be &gt;1 to ensure efficient utilization of the cathode materials. The cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box, then aged for 24 h before the electrochemical tests. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on a ZAHNER PP211 electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were carried out with a Land CT2001A battery tester. The weight of the CuO active materials was determined by subtracting the weight of the residual Cu substrate from the overall weight of the CNE, by using a hydrochloric acid corrosion method. The weight of the CN
