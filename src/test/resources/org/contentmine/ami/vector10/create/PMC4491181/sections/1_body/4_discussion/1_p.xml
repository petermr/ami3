<p>In conclusion, we have developed a CVD process for the direct growth of graphene layers over Si NPs without SiC formation by utilizing CO
 <sub>2</sub> as a mild oxidant. The individual graphene layers are directly anchored to the Si surfaces and thus remain integrated with Si during large volume changes of Si over repeated lithiationâ€“delithiation cycles. The robust growth of graphene layers uniformly around each particle as well as over a large number of particles is attributed to the addition of CO
 <sub>2</sub> in the CVD process that generates catalytic sites on the particle surface. The current approach involving CO
 <sub>2</sub> is expected to hold true for other oxide surfaces that suffer from similar inefficient graphene growth and carbide formation.
