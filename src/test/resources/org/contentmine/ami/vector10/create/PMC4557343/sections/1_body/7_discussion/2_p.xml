<p>Prior high spatial resolution studies of Li-ion cathode materials have similarly been left to infer the behaviour of Li by studying the changes in the local crystallography and the transition metal cation concentration. This study conclusively demonstrates that laser-assisted APT can be used to not only quantify the Ni and Mn composition in 3D but also the Li, and with sufficient accuracy to postulate the phase. There do not appear to be any barriers to studying the spatial distribution of Li for different synthesis methods, common cathode materials and for varying extents of electrochemical cycling of the cathode material. Quantifying the Li distribution by APT can impact the optimization of cathode synthesis procedures to achieve the highest performance, provide key insights toward the atomic-scale mechanism of capacity decay as a function of cycling, and aid in the effort to create novel Li-ion materials with prolonged lifetimes.</p>
