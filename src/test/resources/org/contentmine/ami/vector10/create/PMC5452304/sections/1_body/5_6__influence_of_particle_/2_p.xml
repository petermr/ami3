<p>The density of the graphite anode has an effect on its ability to withstand degradation under strenuous battery operating conditions. A higher anode electrode particle density decreases the porosity and by extension, the active surface area of the electrode which reduces the electrode/electrolyte contact area. Therefore the denser the graphite material, the lower the irreversible capacity [
