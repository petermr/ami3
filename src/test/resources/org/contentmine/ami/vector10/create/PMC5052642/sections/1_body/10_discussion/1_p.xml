<p>For the case of the graphite electrode, our findings confirm much of what was known or what could be logically hypothesized about (de)lithation of graphite electrodes. We observe that, even in our relatively porous electrodes, lithium transport through the pore space is limited ionically rather than electrically, resulting in a lithation front and large SOC gradients. Expansion in the electrode is strongly anisotropic, stemming from the directional expansion of the graphite flakes that are mostly aligned with their flat side parallel to the current collector. The expansion of the particle phase during lithiation by ∼10% is mostly accommodated by the expansion of the electrode as a whole (6–7%), while the fraction of the active phase increases only slightly, leading to small changes in porosity and tortuosity. These changes in microstructure are on the order of the local inhomogenieties of the graphite electrode itself, and therefore do not significantly worsen the electrochemical performance of the cell. Finally, we observed that the cell housing locally affects the expansion of the electrodes indicating that, depending on the type of cell (pouch or wound), its size, and the packaging materials, the extent of particle expansion that can be accommodated by expansion of the electrode may vary.</p>
