 <p>The distribution of cations in Li-ion battery cathodes as a function of cycling is a pivotal characteristic of battery performance. The transition metal cation distribution has been shown to affect cathode performance; however, Li is notoriously challenging to characterize with typical imaging techniques. Here laser-assisted atom probe tomography (APT) is used to map the three-dimensional distribution of Li at a sub-nanometre spatial resolution and correlate it with the distribution of the transition metal cations (

  <sub>0.2</sub>Mn
  <sub>0.6</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> is shown to have Li-rich Li

  <sub>3</sub> phase regions and Li-depleted Li(Ni
  <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
  <sub>0.5</sub>)O
  <sub>2</sub> regions. Cycled material has an overall loss of Li in addition to Ni-, Mn- and Li-rich regions. Spinel LiNi
  <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
  <sub>1.5</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> is shown to have a uniform distribution of all cations. APT results were compared to energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping with a scanning transmission electron microscope to confirm the transition metal cation distribution.
