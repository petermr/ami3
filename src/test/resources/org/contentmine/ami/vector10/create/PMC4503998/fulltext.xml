high reversibility of the system enables sustaining more than 10 000 cycles at
elevated C-rates (&#x02248;10C with respect to the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode), while
retaining up to 85% of its initial capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lithium-ion batteries</kwd><kwd>ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></kwd><kwd>LiFePO<sub>4</sub></kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>carbon nanotubes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1 Introduction</title><p>The lithium-ion battery market is growing beyond expectations. The continuous progresses
achieved by the development of new and/or enhanced materials has led to considerable
improvements in terms of both energy and power densities.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This has enabled, apart from the nowadays-established consumer electronics,
further applications for lithium-ion batteries as, for instance, in the automotive
sector (i.e., electric or hybrid vehicles). Nevertheless, there is still much room for
improvement, especially concerning the high power density demanded by such kind of
applications.</p><p>Since the diffusion of Li ions in and out of the electrode structure is frequently the
rate determining step, this must be improved to allow a fast charge and discharge of the
battery.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> With this goal in mind, scientists
have put substantial efforts on developing new nanostructured materials, which
facilitate the Li ion diffusion due to a reduced diffusion length within the active
material particles and an increased electrode/electrolyte contact area. A variety of
both anode and cathode materials was proposed in form of nanoparticles, nanofibers,
nanotubes, etc.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additionally, highly structured
carbon nanocomposites were developed to enhance not only the ionic but also the
electronic conductivity of the electrode.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> On the

are, so far, the best candidates for use in high power devices. In regard to the
negative electrode, Sn-C,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> electrodeposited Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on a nanostructured

nanocrystalline Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> on carbon nanofibers<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> are some examples of innovative materials with
very promising high rate performances.</p><p>While the scientific literature abounds in studies focusing on the performance of newly
developed active materials in half-cell configuration, there are only very few reports
on full batteries with power-oriented performance. Basically, the most common battery
configurations are Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/LiCoO<sub>2</sub><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and
Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/LiFePO<sub>4</sub>.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The latter system, when activated carbon is added to the positive
electrode, was at the same time also investigated regarding its utilization as a
lithium-ion capacitor.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, the vast
majority of these anyway only few studies utilized
Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> as active material on the anode side. As
an alternative, Derrien et al.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and Brutti et
al.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> recently reported very interesting
results by combining a Sn-C-based anode with
LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and carbon-coated LiFePO<sub>4</sub>
as cathode, respectively. Substituted metal oxides, such as the spinel
ZnCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (e.g., 3D nanowire arrays on carbon cloth), were also
demonstrated to be superior to graphite in terms of rate performance in flexible
lithium-ion cells with LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathodes.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Similar to ZnCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which combines conversion and
alloying mechanism for the reversible lithium storage, ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was
also proposed as high capacity anode,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> offering the great
advantage of being more environmentally friendly, more cost-efficient, and less toxic
due to the replacement of cobalt by iron. Bresser et al.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> demonstrated very recently that, beside the reversible capacity values
exceeding 1000 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, carbon-coated ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
nanoparticles exhibit also excellent rate capability. Nevertheless, within their study
they focused on the characterization of this new active material using half-cells
only.</p><p>Here, we propose for the first time a novel battery configuration wherein carbon-coated
ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles are employed as negative electrode
material and a multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT)-LiFePO<sub>4</sub> composite is used on
the positive electrode side (also referred to here as
ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C/LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-CNT). As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate the great potential of such combination. In addition to the fact that only
electrodes were employed, which were prepared using environmentally friendly,
water-based Na-carboxymethyl cellulose as binder, more remarkably, this new lithium-ion
full-cell provides advanced high rate performance and excellent cycling stability.</p></sec><sec><title>2 Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>2.1 Characterization of LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-CNT Cathode</title><p>Due to their rather poor electronic and ionic conductivities, cathode materials are
frequently limiting the high power performance of lithium-ion batteries. Therefore,
in order to keep up with the excellent rate capability of
ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C anodes (ZFO), carbon-rich LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP)
positive electrodes were prepared. Accordingly, commercial, carbon-coated,
sub-micrometric LFP particles were embedded in an extensive network of multi-walled
carbon nanotubes to form a composite cathode, which is hereinafter called LFP-CNT. As
shown in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a, because of their tubular shape, CNTs form
an extended electronically conductive network interconnecting the single LFP
particles (see inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>a), thus
guaranteeing an efficient and rapid electron transport. In fact, such a large amount
of conductive additive most probably exceeds the electronic percolation threshold.
Additionally, the excess of carbon nanotubes shall ensure an advanced high rate
performance of the commercial LFP particles with respect to the targeted application
in a high power lithium-ion full-cell. In fact, as suggested by Sotowa et al.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> creating sufficient space between the
particles CNT facilitate the electrolyte permeability, hence, decreasing the
concentration polarization when the electrode is subjected to high current loads. As
displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>b, the LFP-CNT positive
electrode has a practical reversible capacity of 158 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>LFP</sub> at C/5. When the applied C rate is increased
to 10C and 20C, such electrodes still provide specific capacities of 90 and 60 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>LFP</sub>, respectively. Considering the initial
capacity, such values account for a capacity retention of &#x02248;56% and
38%. Besides, except for the first cycle, for which an irreversible capacity
of 27 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is observed, the coulombic efficiency of these
LFP-CNT electrodes subjected to galvanostatic charge/discharge is very high, reaching
values of almost 100% at C rates as high as 10C and 20C.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>a) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of LFP-CNT positive electrodes.

Configuration</title><p>The detailed electrochemical characterization of the herein utilized ZFO-based anodes
was already reported previously.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Such
electrodes showed a remarkable rate performance and cycling stability. Being
specifically interesting for the application of these electrodes in a lithium-ion
full-cell, however, the irreversible charge consumption within the first cycle was
slightly less than 30%. This initial irreversible capacity was mainly
attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the
active material particles surface. Nevertheless, with respect to the anyway limited
amount of lithium within a full-cell, the negative electrodes were electrochemically
pre-lithiated prior to their assembly in the
ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C/LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-CNT lithium-ion full-cells.
This pre-lithiation was done by galvanostatic cycling the ZFO anodes in Li half-cells
at relatively low current (C/10, i.e., &#x02248;0.1 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). As
displayed in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>, after a slight increase during the initial
cycles, ZFO anodes reach a stable reversible capacity of 1073 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the 20<sup>th</sup> cycle. ZFO evenly provides capacity
in the potential range from 0 to 2 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. However, it would
be desirable to have a negative electrode mainly operating at rather low potentials
in order to provide a higher energy density of the final lithium-ion full-cell. This
is particularly true when LFP is used as cathode active material, which itself has a
relatively low operating potential. Therefore, within the pre-lithiation step, anodes
with three different lithiation degrees were prepared as shown in the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>. Accordingly, within thus processed
electrodes a specific capacity of 0 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ZFO-deLi), 200 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ZFO-200), and 600 (ZFO-600) mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
remained. These two levels of doping have been chosen to investigate the effect of
the anode Li storage mechanism on the full cell performance. Indeed, doping the
negative electrode with 200 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or 600 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> allows to preferentially exploit the conversion mechanism or
the alloying mechanism, respectively. The doping of the negative electrodes has,
besides the tailoring of the full cell potential, the further function of introducing
a Li reservoir into the system, which might buffer eventual irreversible charge
consumption processes.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Electrochemical pre-lithiation of ZFO-based anodes in half-cell configuration

ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C/LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-CNT</title><p>Here, different types of ZFO/LFP-CNT lithium-ion cells are presented with an average
ZFO/LFP active mass ratio of 0.67. Despite the oversized cathode, the substantially
lower specific capacity of LFP results in a positive to negative capacity ratio of
&#x02248;0.22 (calculated according to the practical capacities of the two active
materials, i.e., about 160 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for LFP, obtained at the
10<sup>th</sup> cycle at C/5; and 1070 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for ZFO, obtained
at the 20<sup>th</sup> cycle at C/10). Hence, the LFP-CNT cathodes in principle limit
the capacity of all cells. Overall, three kinds of full-cells were assembled with
fresh LFP-CNT cathodes and pre-formed ZFO anodes. With respect to the lithiation
degree of the negative electrode, the cells are labeled as follows:
&#x0201c;ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT&#x0201d; (fully de-lithiated anode),
&#x0201c;ZFO-200/LFP-CNT&#x0201d; (anode doped with 200 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and
&#x0201c;ZFO-600/LFP-CNT&#x0201d; (anode doped with 600 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).
Although the doping leads to increased positive to negative capacity ratios (ZFO-200
and ZFO-600 have a practical capacity of &#x02248;870 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and
470 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively), this remains considerably lower than
the unity (i.e., 0.28 and 0.51 for ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively)
and, therefore, all devices are still cathode limited. The performances of this novel
type of battery have been investigated by galvanostatic cycling with current
densities ranging from 0.05 to 6 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Given the different
capacities and active material mass loadings of the individual electrodes, the
current effectively applied to the cells are also reported in A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>a displays the voltage profiles of the
full-cells during the first charge/discharge cycles at a very low current (i.e., 0.1
mA cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). As expected, the partial lithiation of the negative
electrode has a clear influence on the shape of the curves, which, in the case of
ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, show the typical plateau of ZFO at 1 V
(lithiation) and 1.5 V (de-lithiation) vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. The full-cell
employing the ZFO-deLi anode displays a much steeper voltage profile instead.
Besides, the aspect appearing most noteworthy is the influence of the negative
electrode doping level on the average discharge voltage of the cell. While the
ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell has a relatively low cell voltage of 1.58 V, the ZFO-200 and
ZFO-600 anodes operate in a more negative voltage range, thus enabling a considerable
increase of the cell discharge potential up to 1.69 V and 2.12 V, respectively.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Electrochemical performance of ZFO/LFP-CNT full-cells employing ZFO anodes with

discharge capacity values are referred to the active material amount of both
the limiting cathode (i.e., LFP) and the overall cell (i.e., TOT =
LFP+ZFO).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aenm0004-0001-f3"/></fig><p>The capacity delivered by the full-cells under increasing current density is reported
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3b</xref>. All devices display an initial
capacity increase upon the first 20 cycles. Such behavior closely resembles the
results observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>b and, therefore,
can be attributed to the initial activation of the LFP-CNT cathode. The capacity
values obtained at the 20<sup>th</sup> cycle approach the practical capacity of the
positive electrode, accounting for specific capacities ranging from 93 to 101 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> depending on the active material mass loading of both
electrodes. The different lithiation degree of the ZFO anodes does not appear to
considerably affect the rate capability of the full-cells. All cells deliver more
than 50% of the initial capacity for the highest applied current density of 6
mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. It is worth to notice that such a current density
corresponds to 4.89C and 19.23C for ZFO and LFP, respectively. Differently from the
ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cells, which show very stable capacity values at
any current density, the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell seems to suffer of a certain capacity
fading when the current density exceeds 0.5 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. At such
current densities, as clearly noticeable from the voltage profiles displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>c, the ZFO-deLi anode becomes limiting
during the cell discharge. In fact, due to the increasing polarization, the potential
of the fully de-lithiated negative electrode easily reaches the upper cut-off
potential (i.e., 2.8 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, equivalent to the LFP-CNT lower
cut-off), leading to the incomplete utilization of the positive electrode and,
subsequently, to a progressive capacity fading at elevated rates. This phenomenon is
not observed in ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cells for which the anodes,
because of the introduction of a defined amount of Li, operates in a more negative
voltage window, thus buffering the voltage increase caused by polarization. In
<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>a, the average discharge voltage of the
investigated cells is plotted as a function of the applied current density. Up to 1
mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> the doping turns out to be a generally effective strategy
for raising the full-cell discharge potential. However, in the case of the
ZFO-200/LFP-CNT cell, when the load is increased, the average voltage drops to values
comparable (and even lower) to those of the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>a) Effect of the current density on the average discharge voltage of
ZFO/LFP-CNT cells and b) Ragone-like plot displaying their specific energy and
power (referred to the total active material amount, i.e., LFP+ZFO).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aenm0004-0001-f4"/></fig><p>Although it might appear surprising, this is a direct consequence of the previously
mentioned incomplete utilization of the cathode material in the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell
caused by the limiting anode during discharge. As a matter of fact, the positive
electrode voltage does not approach its lower limit during the cell discharge (see
left plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>c). This corresponds to
a higher average cell voltage, but lower capacity. For the cell containing the
ZFO-200 negative electrode, both electrodes are approaching their full discharge
(center plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>c) and thus the
LFP-CNT electrode voltage is steeply decreasing toward the end of the discharge. This
means that the average voltage of the LFP electrode is lower than in the previous
cell, which results in a lower average cell voltage. The cell capacity, however, is
higher.</p><p>Differently, the discharge voltage of the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cell is remarkably retained
upon increasing the current density because of the large amount of lithium stored in
ZFO-600, resulting in a lower average anode voltage. Even for the maximum applied
current density of 6 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, it is 0.43 V higher than that of the
ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell. Such phenomenon would suggest faster kinetics of the alloying
mechanism compared to the conversion mechanism. As clearly shown by the Ragone-like
plot, displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4b</xref>, the
substantially higher cell voltage results in a remarkable improvement in terms of
full-cell specific energy. In fact, while all cells display very high specific power,
even exceeding 3 kW kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (i.e., 3.02 kW kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and
3.72 kW kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 6 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT
and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively), only the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT has a considerably
higher specific energy. Specifically, the doping with 600 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
leads to a gain in specific energy of about 37&#x02013;40% compared to the
other two cells, independently from the applied current. The innovative combination
ZFO/LFP-CNT we propose in this work demonstrates therefore incredibly promising
features. This cell chemistry displays maximum power values similar to those of
lithium-ion capacitors (LIC), while offering considerably higher specific energies.
To the best of our knowledge, the highest specific energies reported for LIC have
been achieved by graphite/AC systems and, referred to the weights of the active
materials, barely exceed 100 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> So far, the highest value (125 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was
obtained by Kim et al., using an artificial graphite anode,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which is considerably lower than the values provided by the
ZFO/LFP-CNT cells. In fact, although we are aware that comparing specific energies
obtained at different power/current is not fully appropriate, we do believe that the
value of 202 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (at 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) shown by
the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT represents a remarkable achievement, testifying the great
potential of such novel battery chemistry. The ZFO/LFP-CNT cells (as well as most
lithium-ion capacitors) contain a not negligible amount of carbon and binder.
However, the specific capacity values are still remarkable (see detailed values
displayed in <bold>Table</bold>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Indeed, considering the total mass of
the electrodes (including active materials, carbon and binder), the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT
cells deliver 132 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Such a value accounts for an improvement
of almost 30% with respect to the 103.8 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> reported by

In fact, as shown in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>a, such cells are able to sustain 10 000
galvanostatic cycles at a current density of 3 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (i.e., 9.61C
for LFP and 2.45C for ZFO) with rather limited capacity fading. After a few
stabilization cycles, the cells deliver rather similar capacities comprised between
42 and 48 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>TOT</sub> (corresponding to 75&#x02013;86 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>LFP</sub>) for the 10<sup>th</sup> discharge. In the
following cycles, however, while for ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT a rather rapid decrease in
capacity after 1000 cycles is observed, the cells assembled with doped anodes display
considerably stable capacity retentions. After 10,000 cycles, ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and
ZFO-600/LFP-CNT still deliver specific capacities of respectively 33 and 41 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>TOT</sub> (i.e., 60 and 74 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>LFP</sub>). In regard to the initial capacities
(considered at the 10<sup>th</sup> cycle) such values account for a capacity
retention of 79% and 85% for ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT,
respectively.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>a) Long-term cycling stability applying a high current density of 3 mA

polarization between charge and discharge. From the selected voltage profiles
displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5b</xref> it is evident that the
ZFO anode is the primary cause of such increase. Structural changes in the active
material, as well as passivation of the electrode surface might be responsible for
this behavior. In any case, such processes seem to take place mainly upon the first
5000 cycles. While this applies strictly to ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, the
performance of the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell appears to be additionally affected by a
continuous capacity loss of the positive electrode. Considering that the cathode is
in this cell the only lithium source besides the electrolyte, it is reasonable to
attribute such decay to the lithium depletion in LFP. This phenomenon is avoided (or
at least significantly delayed) in the other two cells within which, due to the
partial lithiation of the ZFO anodes, a Li reservoir was generated, which is able to
buffer the irreversible charge consumption upon cycling. Apart from this, no
particular ageing phenomenon appears to have a dramatic effect on the performance of
ZFO/LFP-CNT cells. This finding is strongly supported by the impedance spectra
displayed in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>. Indeed, the Nyquist plots recorded after
10 000 cycles highly resemble those of the fresh cells. No additional semicircles or
peculiar features are detected, although, of course, a certain increase of the
overall cell impedance is observed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref> insets, this is mostly due to: i) higher electrolyte resistance
(identified by the high frequency intercept with the Z<sub>real</sub> axis) and ii)
contact/charge transfer resistance (evidenced by the diameter of the high frequency
semicircle). However, such increases are, in our opinion, acceptable for cells
operating for such a large number of cycles.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Impedance spectra of fresh and cycled ZFO/LFP-CNT full-cells. The insets show
in detail the spectra in the medium-high frequency range.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aenm0004-0001-f6"/></fig><p>After recording the impedance spectra, the same full cells that underwent 10 000
cycles at 3 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, have been further cycled at low currents (see

showed stable capacities of 63, 62, and 68 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>TOT</sub>.
In regard to the values obtained at the same current before the stability tests (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>b), these numbers results in
remarkable capacity retentions of 73%, 72%, and 76% for
ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT, ZFO-200/LFP-CNT, and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Galvanostatic cycling at 0.5 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> after long cycling at

anodes was investigated using SEM. SEM images of pristine and cycled electrodes (with
different initial levels of Li doping) are displayed in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>. At a first glance, no dramatic differences
can be observed for pristine and cycled electrodes. This somehow confirms the
previously mentioned (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>) absence
of any particular ageing phenomenon. Nevertheless, a more detailed look reveals some
peculiar features appearing on the electrodes cycled at high current rates for 10 000
cycles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>b, the prolonged
operation of ZFO-deLi at potentials above 1 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup> (resulting
on a main storage of Li through the conversion mechanism) leads to the formation of
large agglomerates, which may be responsible for the voltage profile shape change
previously mentioned (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>b, left
panel). As the anode working potential decreases (in-line with the remaining amount
of lithium within the anode after the doping), these clusters become smaller (i.e.,
ZFO-200, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>c) and practically
disappear in ZFO-600 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>d), for which
the Li is presumably mostly stored via the alloying mechanism with Zn.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>SEM images of ZFO anodes at different magnifications. Comparison between: a)

the first time we have demonstrated, as a proof of concept, the highly promising
features of lithium-ion full-cells combining carbon-coated ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
anodes and composite LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-multi walled carbon nanotubes cathodes.
ZFO/LFP-CNT cells showed remarkable rate capability retaining more than 50% of
the initial capacity at C rates as high as &#x02248;20C with respect to the limiting
cathode. Moreover, a partial lithiation of the ZFO anode does not only enable an
enhanced cycling stability of the full-cell, but does also result in an increased
average full-cell discharge voltage while not substantially affecting the high rate
performance. Among the investigated cells, the battery employing the negative electrode
with the highest lithiation degree (600 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, i.e.,
ZFO-600/LFP-CNT) showed the best performance, delivering a maximum specific energy and
power of 202 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 3.72 kW kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively
(these values refer to the total active material amount of both electrodes). Due to the
high reversibility of this system, such cells show a stable cycling performance at high
current (3 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, i.e., &#x02248;10C with respect to LFP), showing a
capacity retention of 85% after 10 000 cycles. In addition, 76% of the
initial capacity is recovered when cycled subsequently applying lower current densities
of, e.g., 0.5 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Beside the remarkable performance, a great
advantage of this novel high power battery is represented by its environmental friendly
nature. Zn and Fe are benign and highly abundant elements and both electrodes are
produced via aqueous processing employing a cellulose-based binder.</p></sec><sec><title>4 Experimental Section</title><p><italic>Electrode Preparation</italic>: Positive composite electrodes (labelled LFP-CNT)
were prepared by processing all components in water. These were: carbon-coated
LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (C<sub>th</sub>: 170 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; LFP P2,
S&#x000fc;dchemie/Clariant, Germany), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT Nanocyl-3101,
Nanocyl, Belgium) and Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Walocel CRT 2000PA, Dow Wolff
Cellulosics, Germany), in the weight ratio 60:30:10. CMC was firstly dissolved in
milli-Q deionized water to obtain a 1 wt% solution. Afterwards, MWCNT were added
to the binder solution and, in order to promote their dispersion, such an aqueous
mixture was treated in an ultrasonic bath for 2 h. Subsequently, LFP was added to the
obtained homogeneous slurry, further stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h, and then
casted onto aluminium foil by the doctor blade technique (wet film thickness of 400
&#x003bc;m). Negative electrodes (labelled ZFO) were also processed in water by mixing
carbon-coated ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (a detailed description of the synthesis is
given in ref. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <italic>C</italic><sub>th</sub>
&#x02248;1000 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), conductive carbon (Super C65, TIMCAL,
Switzerland), and CMC in the weight ratio 75:20:5. The thus obtained mixture was ball
milled for 2 h and the resulting slurry was then cast on dendritic copper foil (Schlenk,
wet film thickness: 120 &#x003bc;m). The electrode sheets were firstly dried at room
temperature and then transferred to an oven set at 80 &#x000b0;C for further drying
overnight. Positive and negative electrodes (with a mass loading of &#x02248;1.8 and 1.2
mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, respectively) were then punched in disks (diameter: 12 mm)
and dried for additional 12 h under vacuum at 180 &#x000b0;C prior to the electrochemical
and morphological characterization.</p><p><italic>Electrodes and Cells Characterization</italic>: The electrochemical measurements
were carried out in three electrode Swagelok-type cells assembled in an Ar-filled glove
box (MBraun, Germany; oxygen and water content &#x0003c; 0.1 ppm). Polypropylene fleeces
(Freudenberg FS 2226) were used as separators and drenched with 100 &#x003bc;L of
electrolyte (1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylcarbonate (DEC)
mixed in a 3:7 volume ratio). Half-cells, comprising battery grade metallic Li (Rockwood
Lithium, Germany) serving as counter and reference electrodes, were used for: i)
preliminary investigations on the LFP-CNT cathode performance, and ii) the ZFO anodes
pre-formation/doping. The detailed characterization of the negative electrodes in
half-cell configuration was already reported in detail by Bresser et al.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> LFP-CNT composite electrodes were characterized
by galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (2.8&#x02013;4.2 V vs.
Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) at current rates ranging from C/5 to 20C (i.e., from 0.034
to 3.4 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). For the ZFO-based negative electrodes a pre-formation
treatment in half-cells was performed, which was constituted of 20 galvanostatic cycles
in the potential range 3&#x02013;0.05 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup> at C/10 (i.e., 0.1 A
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and, for the partially lithiated ones, of a further reduction
(21<sup>st</sup> cycle) limited to 200 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ZFO-200) or 600 mAh
g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ZFO-600). Prior to their assembly in full-cells, the
pre-formed anodes were disassembled in the glove box and rinsed with fresh electrolyte.
In the full-cells, a reference electrode (metallic Li) was also employed for monitoring
the individual electrode potentials. Upon galvanostatic cycling the operational
potential windows for these were limited to 4.2&#x02013;2.8 V vs.
Li/Li<sup>+</sup> for the LFP-CNT cathode and 2.8&#x02013;0.05 V vs.
Li/Li<sup>+</sup> for the ZFO anode. Hence, the maximum cell voltage window
allowed was 4.15 V. Rate capability tests were performed at current densities as high as
6 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, corresponding to almost 20C for LFP-CNT and 5C for ZFO.
Impedance spectra of fresh and cycled (after 10 000 cycles) cells were collected under
rest conditions (open circuit potential) in the frequency range comprised between 500
kHz and 10 mHz, with a sinusoidal amplitude of 5 mV. All electrochemical measurements
were performed by means of a programmable multi-channel potentiostat-galvanostat (VMP3,
Biologic Science Instruments) in a climatic chamber (KBF115, Binder GmbH) at 20
&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C. The morphology of both fresh and aged electrodes was
also investigated by means of SEM. The cells containing the aged electrodes were
disassembled in an Ar-filled glove box (MBraun), and the electrodes were carefully
rinsed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In order to avoid contact with air and moisture,
the samples have been transferred to the microscope using a homemade vacuum-sealed
sample holder. Electrodes micrographs were acquired with a Carl Zeiss AURIGA Scanning
Electron Microscope equipped with a field emission electron gun as electron source and
an in-lens detector. The acceleration voltage was set to 3 kV.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the University of M&#x000fc;nster, the
