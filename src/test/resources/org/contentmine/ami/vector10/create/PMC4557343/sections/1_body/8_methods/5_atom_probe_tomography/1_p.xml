<p>Laser-assisted APT analysis was conducted using a CAMECA LEAP4000 × HR atom probe tomography system with a 355-nm ultraviolet laser, 20-pJ laser pulse energy, 40 K specimen temperature and evaporation rate maintained at 0.005 atoms per pulse. APT data were reconstructed and analysed using IVAS 3.6.6 software.</p>
