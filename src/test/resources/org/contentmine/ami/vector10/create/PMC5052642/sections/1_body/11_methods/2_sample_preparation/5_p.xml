<p>The silicon/graphite-lithium cell was assembled in exactly the same way, except the top electrode was exchanged for a disk punched out from a metallic lithium foil (Alpha Aesar, lithium foil, 99.9%) acting as lithium reservoir. Thereby we avoid the high capacity loss associated with the irreversible capacity of silicon in the first electrochemical cycle.</p>
