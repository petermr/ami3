<p>Having carried out systematic performance evaluations for both the PSCs and LFPO/LTO-based LIBs, we used the PSC unit with four single PSCs connected in series to directly photo-charge a LFPO–LTO LIB at an current density of 0.5 C (0.085 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1 C=170 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>), which matches well with the photogenerated current density from the PSC unit over the voltage range of 2.0–2.5 V (4.61–4.52 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and 0.087–0.085 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> shows photo-charge (blue lines) and galvanostatic discharge (black lines) curves of a LIB repeatedly photo-charged by the connected PSC unit (PSCs–LIB) for 10 cycles at 0.5 C between 1.0 and 2.6 V. To compare with the photo-charging, we also performed galvanostatic charge–discharge of the same LIB cell, using an automatic battery tester system (Land, China) as power supply (PS) after the completion of the 10 photo-charge/galvanostatic discharge cycles (PS-LIB, red lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, the PSCs–LIB and PS-LIB cells showed almost identical very stable discharge–charge curves over all the cycles, indicating excellent capabilities of the PSCs for photo-charging LIBs. Even after continued illumination under AM1.5G for 17.8 h over 10 repeated photo-charge and galvanostatic discharge cycles (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref> (blue dots), the fabricated PSCs–LIB cell delivered an initial reversible capacity of 140.4 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> while maintained a reversible capacity of 111.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 10 photo-charge and galvanostatic discharge cycles (that is, 79.49% initial capacity, ∼2.05% decay per cycle). This was followed by a highly reversible capacity of 111.1 mAh g
