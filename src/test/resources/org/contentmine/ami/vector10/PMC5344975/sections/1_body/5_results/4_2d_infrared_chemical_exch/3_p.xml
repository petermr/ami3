 <sup>−1</sup> increases (see the 2D infrared spectra inside the red boxes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), which clearly indicates the chemical exchange or configurational transition from Li–DMC to free DMC. In contrast, we could not find any cross peak features between Li–PC and free PC in our 2D infrared spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10–12</xref> within our experimental timescale. This suggests that the electrostatic interaction between PC and Li
 <sup>+</sup> in LIB electrolyte solutions is stronger than that between DMC (or DEC) and Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which is consistent with the notion that the PC molecule with large dipole moment compared to that of DEC molecule tends to make a stable and rigid solvation sheath around a lithium cation in LIB electrolyte solutions.
