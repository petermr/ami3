<p>The infrared absorption spectra of the C=O stretch and O−C−O asymmetric stretch modes in LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> DEC solutions at different concentrations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, respectively. DEC has three strongly infrared-active modes in the fingerprint region, which are C=O stretching (1,747 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), O−C−O asymmetric stretching (1,258.9 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), and O−CH
 <sub>2</sub>−CH
 <sub>3</sub> asymmetric stretching (1,022 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) vibrations. As LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentration in the DEC solution increases, two distinctively new peaks at 1,715.4 and 1,305.6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> appear. The frequencies and spectral widths of the main peaks at 1,747 and 1,258.9 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> do not change much on increasing lithium salt concentration. Therefore, the two new peaks at 1,715.4 and 1,305.6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be safely assigned to the C=O stretch and O−C−O asymmetric stretch modes of DEC molecules directly interacting with Li
 <sup>+</sup>.
