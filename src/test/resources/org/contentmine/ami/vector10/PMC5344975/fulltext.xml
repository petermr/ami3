Electrolyte solution in lithium-ion battery is usually based on mixed solvents consisting of polar carbonates with different aliphatic chains. Despite various experimental evidences indicating that lithium ion forms a rigid and stable solvation sheath through electrostatic interactions with polar carbonates, both the lithium solvation structure and more importantly fluctuation dynamics and functional role of carbonate solvent molecules have not been fully elucidated yet with femtosecond vibrational spectroscopic methods.

Among various components in LIB, the properties and dynamics of carbonate-based solvents govern the mobility and stability of charge carrier, Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cation, in LIB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Because Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion mobility is much lower than electrons in metal wires, the solvation dynamics of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in electrolyte solutions is crucial in determining the LIB performance. Typical electrolyte solutions used in LIB are composed of non-aqueous carbonate solvents that have certain advantages. For instance, the oxidation potential can be matched to the output voltage of LIB and carbonate solvents are also building blocks of solid-electrolyte interphase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>To achieve high Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> conductivity, mixed solvents have often been used not only because they increase the solubility of lithium salt but also because they serve as excellent media facilitating fast transport of Li-ion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Cyclic carbonates, such as propylene carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate (EC), have high dielectric constants so that they enhance the dissociation of lithium salt by stabilizing ions. However, their high viscosity limits the fast Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transport. To enhance Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion mobility as well as to improve low-temperature performance, linear alkyl carbonates like diethyl carbonate (DEC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) are added to the LIB electrolyte solutions as co-solvents. It has long been believed that such low viscosity co-solvents act as a medium for transporting the sheaths of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion-solvent complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the current commercial LIBs, lithium salt, 1.0&#x02009;M LiPF<sub>6</sub>, is dissolved in organic carbonate mixed solvents consisting of equal volumetric amounts of DEC, DMC and EC. Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is believed to be preferentially solvated by EC, and DEC and/or DMC provides the medium for large Li&#x02013;EC complexes to flow between electrodes during charging and discharging processes. However, to our surprise, detailed microscopic solvation structures and ultrafast solvation dynamics around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in such electrolyte solutions have not been fully understood and even they are still the key subjects under intense scholarly debate.</p><p>Therefore, elucidating the molecular solvation structure of organic carbonates around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> would, without a doubt, help one to better understand the working principles of LIB and to eventually design an improved LIB. Most of the previous studies primarily focused on the equilibrium structure of the first solvation shell of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, which has often been referred to as solvation sheath due to its rigidity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. For instance, Raman spectroscopy of LIB electrolyte solutions revealed the existence of preferential solvation shell around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in mixed solvent electrolyte solutions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This was also confirmed by Bogle <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> where <sup>17</sup>O NMR experiments show that Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> makes a direct electrostatic interaction with carbonyl oxygen atoms of surrounding carbonates. Even in the case that Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is preferentially solvated by EC or PC, the participation of co-solvent molecules, such as DEC and DMC, in the solvation sheath is possible not only because of their high-mole fractions but also because of extra entropic gain. Therefore, it is by now clear that such co-solvents could potentially play a dual-role of low-viscous medium and solvating molecule. Co-solvents like DEC and DMC would add an extra flexibility to solvation sheath, because they comparatively weakly interact with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and have many conformational degrees of freedom<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Nevertheless, no direct evidence of fast fluxional solvent exchange dynamics in Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solvation sheath has been reported due to their ultrafast nature and experimental difficulties in finding an appropriate spectroscopic probe.</p><p>In this regard, we believe that time-resolved nonlinear infrared spectroscopy is an ideal method capable of providing critical information on ultrafast chemical exchanges between different solvation structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> that cannot be easily distinguished by NMR or other spectroscopic means due either to their limited time-resolving power or to a lack of spectroscopic probe enabling one to track local configurational changes around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion. Here considering the carbonyl stretching vibration of DEC as an infrared probe, we carried out Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), femtosecond infrared pump-probe and two-dimensional (2D) infrared studies of chemical exchange processes between DEC molecules with and without Coulombic interaction with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. One of the most difficult problems in the present linear and nonlinear infrared spectroscopic investigations is that the infrared probe, DEC, itself is the solvent too. Thus, with normal infrared cells with several micrometre thickness at best, the linear absorption is saturated and the nonlinear infrared signal fields are self-attenuated, which renders a difficulty in detecting weak 2D infrared signal. To overcome this, we prepared a home-built thin sample cell coated with SiO<sub>2</sub>, using radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Here we show evidence on the ultrafast formation and dissociation dynamics of Li&#x02013;carbonate solvation complexes in the LIB electrolyte solutions by analysing the FTIR spectra and time-resolved infrared pump-probe and 2D infrared data of C=O stretch modes in lithium salt electrolyte solutions and carrying out quantum chemistry calculations. In particular, the time constant associated with the breaking of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;DEC electrostatic interaction is found to be 2.2&#x02009;ps and that with the formation of the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;DEC bond is 17.5&#x02009;ps at 1.0&#x02009;M LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentration in DEC solvent. The timescales of making and breaking of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;DMC interaction bonds in PC/DMC mixed solvents are similar to those for DEC solutions, which indicates that the DMC molecules also participate in the formation of lithium cation solvation shell even in such mixed electrolyte solutions used in a real LIB. We anticipate that such ultrafast fluxional dynamics in solvation shell structures around lithium cations are of importance in understanding lithium-ion mobility in LIB solutions.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>FTIR spectroscopy</title><p>The infrared absorption spectra of the C=O stretch and O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O asymmetric stretch modes in LiPF<sub>6</sub> DEC solutions at different concentrations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, respectively. DEC has three strongly infrared-active modes in the fingerprint region, which are C=O stretching (1,747&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O asymmetric stretching (1,258.9&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and O&#x02212;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x02212;CH<sub>3</sub> asymmetric stretching (1,022&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) vibrations. As LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentration in the DEC solution increases, two distinctively new peaks at 1,715.4 and 1,305.6&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> appear. The frequencies and spectral widths of the main peaks at 1,747 and 1,258.9&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> do not change much on increasing lithium salt concentration. Therefore, the two new peaks at 1,715.4 and 1,305.6&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can be safely assigned to the C=O stretch and O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O asymmetric stretch modes of DEC molecules directly interacting with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>However, it is noted that a DEC molecule has three different sites for electrostatic interaction with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. They are two ester ether oxygen atoms and one carbonyl oxygen atom. Therefore, at least two structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> should be considered as possible Li&#x02013;DEC complexes. Despite that a recent <sup>17</sup>O NMR experiment provided evidence that the ester ether oxygen atoms do not strongly interact with Li-ion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, it is not entirely clear whether this is the case even at high (1.0&#x02009;M) lithium salt concentration. To pin point the Li&#x02013;DEC complex structure among the two in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, quantum chemistry calculations and vibrational analyses of a few complexes were performed with DFT method at the level of B3LYP/6-311&#x0002b;&#x0002b;G(3df,2pd). For an isolated DEC, the C=O stretch and O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O asymmetric stretch frequencies are found to be 1,714.4&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1,235.5&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (detailed descriptions on the quantum chemistry calculation results are found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Then, the DFT calculations of two structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> show that the C=O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) is more stable by 3.26&#x02009;kcal&#x02009;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> than the O=C&#x02212;O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> complex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>. Furthermore, when Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> interacts with carbonyl oxygen atom, the C=O stretch frequency is red shifted by 112.2&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and simultaneously the O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O asymmetric stretch frequency is blue shifted by 62.6&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the complex formation of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> with two ester ether oxygen atoms of DEC induces strong blue shift (112.4&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of C=O frequency and red shift (96.8&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O asymmetric stretch frequency. These results can be understood by noting that the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion interacting with carbonyl oxygen atom makes the double bond character (or bond length) of C=O group decrease (increase), which concomitantly makes the C&#x02212;O bond lengths short (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). When Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> electrostatically interacts with ester ether oxygen atom, exactly the opposite charge redistribution occurs. Thus, our infrared results are consistent with the previous notion that Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> preferentially interacts with carbonyl oxygen atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In fact, such frequency shifting behaviours of C=O and O&#x02212;C&#x02212;O modes in DEC on the formation of C=O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> complex are quite similar to the red and blue shifts of amide I and II modes of peptide bond, respectively, which are mainly C=O stretch and C&#x02212;N stretch of the peptide bond, respectively, when the amide carbonyl oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. Despite that the quantum chemistry calculations for the two different complex structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> are consistent with previous findings and our experimental FT-IR results discussed below, the C=O stretch frequency may depend also on the side chain (ethyl group) conformation. More specifically, the molecular dipole moment of the <italic>cis</italic> conformation can be larger than that of the <italic>trans</italic> conformation so that the <italic>cis</italic> conformer can make a bit stronger interaction with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and form a more stable Li&#x02013;DEC complex.</p><p>The number of solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of a solute molecule is an important quantity providing information on the size and structure of Li-ion solvation sheath. Often, a series of lithium salt concentration-dependent spectroscopic experiments has been used to determine the solvation number around a Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in various electrolyte solutions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, Doucey <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> showed that the formation of contact ion pair (CIP) between two oppositely charged ions should also be taken into account in quantitatively interpreting the infrared spectra of LIB solutions. That means, the concentration of dissolved LiPF<sub>6</sub> is not necessarily identical to the concentration of DEC-solvated Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion because there could exist non-negligible amount of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> CIP. Thus, it is necessary to consider three different DEC species that are (i) DEC surrounded by other DECs, (ii) DEC interacting with free Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and (iii) DEC interacting with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the CIP state, Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>. In addition, the existence of two different types of anions, either PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> solvated by DECs or PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> in CIP imposes yet another complexity to the interpretation of linear and nonlinear infrared spectra. However, because the negatively charged PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> tends to be away from the carbonate part of DEC due to Coulomb repulsion and preferentially surrounded by the DEC ethyl groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> does not strongly affect the DEC carbonyl stretch infrared spectrum.</p><p>To gain more insight into the vibrational properties of DEC&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as compared to DEC&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, we further analysed density functional theory calculation results of DEC interacting with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Even in the case of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, still the carbonyl oxygen atom of DEC is the binding site forming C=O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> complex, though the C=O frequency red shift in that case is a bit smaller than that of C=O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. If the first solvation shell structure around free Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is spectroscopically different from that around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, one might expect to see clear signature, that is, a new third infrared absorption band or shoulder in the lower-frequency region. A careful examination of the C=O band of LiPF<sub>6</sub> DEC solution, where the total C=O stretch infrared band was corrected by subtracting that of pure DEC liquid, shows no discernible spectroscopic feature of DEC-CIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, it is concluded that the carbonyl stretch infrared band consists of indistinguishable contributions from both C=O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and C=O&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> complexes, which altogether will be referred to as Li&#x02013;DEC complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Polarization-controlled infrared pump-probe</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a,b</xref> displays the dispersive isotropic pump-probe signals obtained from pure DEC liquid and 1.0&#x02009;M LiPF<sub>6</sub> DEC solution, respectively. The time-resolved pump-probe spectra of LiPF<sub>6</sub> in DEC solution show complicated spectral features due to the destructive interference between the negative 1&#x02013;2 transition peak (excited state absorption transition from |1&#x0003e; to |2&#x0003e;) of free DEC and the positive 0&#x02013;1 peak (ground state |0&#x0003e; bleach and stimulated emission from |1&#x0003e; to |0&#x0003e;) of Li&#x02013;DEC complex at around 1,720&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Another notable feature is the prolonged positive signal (around 1,750&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) that is associated with local heating effect due to the vibrational energy relaxation of infrared-pump-excited C=O stretch modes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The vibrational lifetime could be extracted from the fitting analysis of the 1&#x02013;2 transition PP data that are relatively immune to local heating effect. Note that the decay constants of the excited state absorption signals at around 1,725&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1,700&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, for pure DEC liquid and 1.0&#x02009;M LiPF<sub>6</sub> DEC solution, are little dependent on the probe frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). On the other hand, the exponential decay constants obtained from the fits of positive 0&#x02013;1 signals at &#x0223c;1,750&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> show a strong probe-frequency dependence, which is mainly due to the local heating contribution to the infrared PP signal. Thus, the isotropic and anisotropic data at the 1&#x02013;2 transition frequencies at &#x0223c;1,700&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were taken into consideration to extract information on the vibrational and orientational relaxation times of Li&#x02013;DEC complex. The corresponding time constants of free DEC were obtained from the excited state absorption signal at 1,725&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the infrared PP data of pure DEC solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p>Vibrational lifetime of Li&#x02013;DEC complex (1.1&#x000b1;0.1&#x02009;ps) is found to be much shorter than that of free DEC (2.1&#x000b1;0.1&#x02009;ps).

At a very short waiting time of <italic>T</italic><sub>w</sub>=0.3&#x02009;ps, there are only two peaks on the diagonal line (see the upper-left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), which correspond to the two absorption peaks in the FTIR spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>. The positive peaks (red colour) result from the ground state bleaching and stimulated emission contributions, whereas the negative peaks (blue colour) in the lower frequency region along the probe frequency (<italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>t</sub>) axis are the excited state absorption contributions.

We found that the C=O stretch frequency&#x02013;frequency correlation decays on a few picosecond timescale, which could result from ultrafast internal rotations of the ethyl groups in DEC and hindered rotational motions of carbonates.</p><p>In principle, the inhomogeneous structural distribution can be studied by analysing the centre or nodal line slope and/or diagonal ellipticities of 2D infrared peaks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Unfortunately, due to the destructive interference between the positive 0&#x02013;1 peak from Li&#x02013;DEC and the negative 1&#x02013;2 peak from free DEC, it is difficult to clearly identify the corresponding 2D infrared feature. Thus, we compared the infrared absorption linewidths of free DEC and Li&#x02013;DEC complex with the help of pump-probe data. The FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) of the infrared spectrum of Li&#x02013;DEC is found to be 22.2&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is slightly broader than that of free DEC (FWHM=18.9&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). However, the vibrational lifetime of Li&#x02013;DEC is just half of that of the free DEC, which means that the lifetime broadening of Li&#x02013;DEC is larger than that of free DEC. These observations indicate that the inhomogeneous linewidth of Li&#x02013;DEC may be narrower than free DEC, which is consistent with the notion that DEC molecules in Li&#x02013;DEC complexes have stable conformers and the side-chain structure can be correlated with its solvation property<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p>In a real LIB electrolyte solution, detailed solvation dynamics around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> could be affected by the presence of co-solvents in the first solvation shell. In a recent <sup>17</sup>O NMR experiment, NMR peak of carbonyl oxygen atom in EC or DMC shows a motional narrowing behaviour, indicating the existence of fast equilibrium dynamics between free carbonate and Li-complexed carbonate molecules in nanosecond or even shorter timescales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, it has long been believed that such fast solvent exchange dynamics can occur only in the second solvation shell because of the belief that the first solvation shell maintains its rigid structure during the Li-transport between electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, if Li-solvent complexes undergo fast solvent exchange dynamics resulting in ultrafast fluctuation of coordination number and solvation structure, the conventional view on the robust and rigid solvation sheath formation must be reconsidered. Especially the coordination number fluctuation would modulate the diffusion rate of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in LIB electrolyte solutions. To date, however, little has been understood about how fast the solvation dynamics and the structural fluctuation of solvation sheath.</p><p>In this regard, the 2D infrared spectroscopy is an ideal tool for studying such ultrafast structural changes inside each solvation shell, because it is capable of tracking frequency changes of infrared probe (C=O stretch mode of DEC in the present case) induced by conformational transitions between different solvation structures. Indeed, at longer waiting time (<italic>T</italic><sub>w</sub>&#x0003e;2&#x02009;ps), one can clearly observe cross peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The positive cross peak on the upper-left corner results from the breaking of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;DEC, that is, transition from Li&#x02013;DEC to free DEC, which reduces the number of DEC solvent molecules in the first solvation shell (the backward reaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Another positive cross peak appears on the lower-right corner, even though its magnitude is comparatively weak because of its destructive interference with the negative diagonal peak from free DEC. The positive and negative cross peaks in the lower-right corner represent the formation of Li&#x02013;DEC complex or the increase of coordination number around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion (the forward reaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p>The Li&#x02013;DEC coordination breaking and forming dynamics are manifested in the <italic>T</italic><sub>w</sub>- dependent cross peak intensity changes on the 2D infrared spectra.

The transition dipole strength of DEC&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>(ligands)<sub>n&#x02013;1</sub> is 1.7 times larger than that of free DEC, which is in excellent agreement with quantum chemistry calculation results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table 2</xref>). With the experimentally measured transition dipole ratio of 1.7, the population ratio of DEC&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>(ligands)<sub>n&#x02013;1</sub> to DEC is found to be 0.138, that is, [DEC&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>(ligands)<sub>n&#x02013;1</sub>]/[free DEC]=0.138. From the peak volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) obtained through a 2D Gaussian fitting analysis of 2D infrared spectrum, the time-dependent concentrations of free DEC and Li&#x02013;DEC complex were obtained. All the other parameters required in the present volume fitting analyses of 2D infrared data were obtained from the FTIR and infrared pump-probe measurements. The two-state-model fit curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Finally, it is found that the time constant associated with the breaking of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;DEC is 2.2&#x02009;ps and that with the formation of one Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;DEC bond is 17.5&#x02009;ps at 1.0&#x02009;M LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentration.</p><p>Although our experimental observations clearly show the ultrafast chemical exchange dynamics in lithium-ion solvation sheath, we still need to consider another possibility that the increasing cross peaks could result from vibrational excitation transfers between free DEC and Li&#x02013;DEC complex. Indeed, the vibration energy transfer between donor and acceptor molecules with different transition frequencies can produce cross peaks of which intensities increase in time <italic>T</italic><sub>w</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Unlike the case of chemical exchange-induced cross peaks, the increase rate of the upper-left cross peak intensity should differ from that of the lower-right cross peak intensity, because they are produced by up- and down-hill transitions, respectively.</p><p>Unfortunately, the lower-right positive cross peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> overlaps with the negative diagonal peak from the free DEC, which obscures the time-dependent features of the cross peaks. We thus compared the time-dependent increase of the upper-left positive cross peak and that of the lower-right negative peak, assuming that the chemical exchange dynamics of DECs (either free DEC or Li&#x02013;DEC complex) in their excited states are similar to those in their ground states. To rule out the possibility that the 2D infrared cross peaks originate from vibrational excitation transfers between free DEC and Li&#x02013;DEC complex, we further carried out a series of concentration-dependent pump-probe measurements at four different LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentrations in the range from 0.2 to 1.0&#x02009;M (detailed analysis on pump-probe results are found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). A decrease in LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentration would significantly reduce the chance for a free DEC to encounter Li-complexed DEC molecules. This should result in an increase of vibrational lifetime of free DEC, if the vibrational energy transfer between free DEC and complex DEC occurs within a few picosecond timescale. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, the vibrational lifetime of free DEC is independent of LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentration. This confirms that the cross peaks observed in our 2D infrared spectra originate from ultrafast chemical exchange processes in the solvation sheath of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in DEC electrolyte solution.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>2D infrared chemical exchange spectroscopy of mixed solvent</title><p>Despite that the ultrafast chemical exchange dynamics between free DEC and Li&#x02013;DEC complex was observed in pure DEC solutions, typical LIB's use mixed solvents instead.

Here it should be noted that we considered DMC:PC mixed solvents instead of DEC:PC mixed solvents because of the following reasons. First, since the C=O stretching vibrational lifetime of DMC is comparatively longer than that of DEC, we could observe measurable diagonal and cross peaks of free DMC and Li&#x02013;DMC complex in our 2D infrared spectra at long waiting times.

Combining FTIR spectroscopy, infrared pump-probe measurement and quantum chemistry calculation results, we completely characterized the vibrational properties of free DEC and Li&#x02013;DEC complexes in both pure DEC solvent and mixed solvents consisting of DEC and PC. Subsequent 2D infrared data analyses revealed the ultrafast nature of chemical exchange dynamics in the immediate vicinity of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in DEC solution. Here one of the most difficult challenges was to prepare very thin solution samples because the infrared probes are the C=O stretch modes of DEC and PC molecules that are also solvents. Using RF magnetron sputtering technique, we could control the thickness of coated SiO<sub>2</sub> layer on CaF<sub>2</sub> window for linear and nonlinear infrared spectroscopic studies. The picosecond Li&#x02013;DEC complex making and breaking dynamics in both pure DEC solution and DMC:PC mixed solution suggest that the macroscopic Li transport during both charging and discharging processes might be interrelated to microscopic solvation fluctuation and discrete transitions between different solvation states of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in LIB electrolyte solutions. We anticipate that the present ultrafast chemical exchange dynamics should also play an important role in solvation and de-solvation of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at the solid-electrolyte interface on electrodes because of the following reason. If the rigidity of each Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solvation sheath is very high, any de-solvation of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> on the anode surface may not be efficient, which potentially restricts the function of LIB due to lowering the rate of lithium deposition on the anode. On the other hand, if the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solvation sheath is not sufficiently stable due to a low dissolving power of solvent, the rate of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> release from the cathode could be slow. Therefore, it is naturally expected that ideal LIB solvent molecules should interact with Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> with a properly balanced strength. Overall, the unexpected ultrafast fluxional solvation processes around Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the LIB electrolyte solution is turned out to be prerequisite for optimally achieving the functional role of carbonate solvent in LIB. We anticipate that a further 2D infrared investigation on the Li-solvent fluctuation dynamics during both charging and discharging processes would provide critical information on the fluctuation-dissipation relationship between equilibrium microscopic solvent fluctuation and non-equilibrium macroscopic charge transport phenomenon.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sample preparation for infrared measurement</title><p>Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>, Battery grade, purity &#x0003e;99.99&#x00025; trace metal basis) and DEC (purity &#x0003e;99&#x00025;) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Since the infrared chromophore, DEC, is also solvent, the transmittance of infrared beam is very low so that an infrared sample holder with extremely narrow path length was needed. Previously, to overcome a similar difficulty, Cowan <italic>et al</italic>. used a ultra-thin sample cell consisting of 2&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 2&#x02009;mm window of 800&#x02009;nm-thick Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> for 2D infrared study of pure water, where the effective thickness of water flow channel was controlled to be 500&#x02009;nm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).

In the infrared pump-probe and 2D infrared measurements, to minimize the re-absorption of the generated third-order infrared signal electric field, that is, self-attenuation problem, the absorbance of DEC carbonyl stretching mode was adjusted to be less than 0.4, which was achieved by using 800&#x02009;nm path length. All the infrared spectra were measured on Jasco 6300 FV spectrometer with a circulating water bath for temperature control. This spectrometer is equipped with a DLATGS detector with Peltier element in the absorbance mode range from 450 to 7,800&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with frequency resolution of 0.07&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. During the measurements, N<sub>2</sub> gas is purged to suppress any vapour noise and to minimize undesired water condensation on the CaF<sub>2</sub> window.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Polarization selective infrared pump-probe and 2D infrared spectroscopy</title><p>Experimental details of pump-probe and 2D infrared spectroscopy employed in the present study have been described elsewhere. Briefly, 800&#x02009;nm pulses with duration of &#x0223c;100&#x02009;fs and 1.0&#x02009;mJ were generated from Ti:Sapphire oscillator and regenerative amplifier operating at 1&#x02009;KHz, which were then used to produce near- infrared pulses at &#x0223c;1.4 and &#x0223c;1.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. With AgGaS nonlinear optical crystal, the signal and idler pulses are mixed to generate mid-infrared pulses with &#x0223c;8&#x02009;&#x003bc;J per pulse and &#x0223c;100&#x02009;fs duration centred at 2,070&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. For polarization-selective infrared pump-probe measurements, wire grid polarizers were used to set the polarization directions of the pump and probe beams to be 45&#x000b0; and 0&#x000b0; before the sample. The probe beam was resolved after the sample to either &#x0002b;45&#x000b0; (parallel) or &#x02212;45&#x000b0; (perpendicular) by a linear polarizer on a computer-controlled rotator, sent through a polarizer fixed to 0&#x000b0; into the spectrograph, and detected by a 32-element array detector.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MD simulation method</title><p>Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed for LiPF<sub>6</sub>-DEC solutions at 1.0&#x02009;M LiPF<sub>6</sub> concentration, where 378 LiPF<sub>6</sub> molecules were dissolved in 1,000 DEC molecules.

The particle mesh Ewald method was used for long-range electrostatic interaction and the cutoff distance for nonbonding interaction was set to be 10&#x02009;&#x000c5;.
