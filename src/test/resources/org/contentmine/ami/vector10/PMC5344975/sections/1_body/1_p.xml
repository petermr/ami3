<p>To achieve high Li
 <sup>+</sup> conductivity, mixed solvents have often been used not only because they increase the solubility of lithium salt but also because they serve as excellent media facilitating fast transport of Li-ion
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Cyclic carbonates, such as propylene carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate (EC), have high dielectric constants so that they enhance the dissociation of lithium salt by stabilizing ions. However, their high viscosity limits the fast Li
 <sup>+</sup> transport. To enhance Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion mobility as well as to improve low-temperature performance, linear alkyl carbonates like diethyl carbonate (DEC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) are added to the LIB electrolyte solutions as co-solvents. It has long been believed that such low viscosity co-solvents act as a medium for transporting the sheaths of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion-solvent complex
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the current commercial LIBs, lithium salt, 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>, is dissolved in organic carbonate mixed solvents consisting of equal volumetric amounts of DEC, DMC and EC. Li
 <sup>+</sup> is believed to be preferentially solvated by EC, and DEC and/or DMC provides the medium for large Li–EC complexes to flow between electrodes during charging and discharging processes. However, to our surprise, detailed microscopic solvation structures and ultrafast solvation dynamics around Li
 <sup>+</sup> in such electrolyte solutions have not been fully understood and even they are still the key subjects under intense scholarly debate.
