 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a,b</xref> displays the dispersive isotropic pump-probe signals obtained from pure DEC liquid and 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> DEC solution, respectively. The time-resolved pump-probe spectra of LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in DEC solution show complicated spectral features due to the destructive interference between the negative 1–2 transition peak (excited state absorption transition from |1&gt; to |2&gt;) of free DEC and the positive 0–1 peak (ground state |0&gt; bleach and stimulated emission from |1&gt; to |0&gt;) of Li–DEC complex at around 1,720 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Another notable feature is the prolonged positive signal (around 1,750 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) that is associated with local heating effect due to the vibrational energy relaxation of infrared-pump-excited C=O stretch modes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The vibrational lifetime could be extracted from the fitting analysis of the 1–2 transition PP data that are relatively immune to local heating effect. Note that the decay constants of the excited state absorption signals at around 1,725 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1,700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, for pure DEC liquid and 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> DEC solution, are little dependent on the probe frequency (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). On the other hand, the exponential decay constants obtained from the fits of positive 0–1 signals at ∼1,750 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> show a strong probe-frequency dependence, which is mainly due to the local heating contribution to the infrared PP signal. Thus, the isotropic and anisotropic data at the 1–2 transition frequencies at ∼1,700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were taken into consideration to extract information on the vibrational and orientational relaxation times of Li–DEC complex. The corresponding time constants of free DEC were obtained from the excited state absorption signal at 1,725 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the infrared PP data of pure DEC solvent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).
