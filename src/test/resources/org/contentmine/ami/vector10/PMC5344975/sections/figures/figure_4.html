 <caption> Equilibrium structure and kinetic analysis of 2D infrared spectrum. ( a) A schematic picture on the chemical equilibrium between two solvation structures. The left consists of Li-complex with three bound DECs and one free DEC, whereas the right represents the tetra-coordinated Liâ€“DEC complex. ( b) The time-dependent diagonal and cross peak volumes obtained from the experimentally measured 2D infrared spectra are plotted. The fitted (solid) curves are also shown here. </caption>
