<p>Therefore, elucidating the molecular solvation structure of organic carbonates around Li
 <sup>+</sup> would, without a doubt, help one to better understand the working principles of LIB and to eventually design an improved LIB. Most of the previous studies primarily focused on the equilibrium structure of the first solvation shell of Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which has often been referred to as solvation sheath due to its rigidity

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. For instance, Raman spectroscopy of LIB electrolyte solutions revealed the existence of preferential solvation shell around Li
 <sup>+</sup> in mixed solvent electrolyte solutions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This was also confirmed by Bogle

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> where 
 <sup>17</sup>O NMR experiments show that Li
 <sup>+</sup> makes a direct electrostatic interaction with carbonyl oxygen atoms of surrounding carbonates. Even in the case that Li
 <sup>+</sup> is preferentially solvated by EC or PC, the participation of co-solvent molecules, such as DEC and DMC, in the solvation sheath is possible not only because of their high-mole fractions but also because of extra entropic gain. Therefore, it is by now clear that such co-solvents could potentially play a dual-role of low-viscous medium and solvating molecule. Co-solvents like DEC and DMC would add an extra flexibility to solvation sheath, because they comparatively weakly interact with Li
 <sup>+</sup> and have many conformational degrees of freedom
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Nevertheless, no direct evidence of fast fluxional solvent exchange dynamics in Li
 <sup>+</sup> solvation sheath has been reported due to their ultrafast nature and experimental difficulties in finding an appropriate spectroscopic probe.
