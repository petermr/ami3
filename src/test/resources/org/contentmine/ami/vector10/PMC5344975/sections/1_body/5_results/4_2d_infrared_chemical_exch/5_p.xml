<p>From the 2D Gaussian fit to the 2D infrared spectra (at 10 ps) for 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/DEC solution shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, we found that the intensity ratio, which is a dimensionless quantity, is 0.67. Now, for the 2D infrared spectra (10 ps) for 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/DMC:PC (1:1) solution in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, our estimated intensity ratio is 0.76. In the cases of the 1.5 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/DMC:PC (1.5:1) and 2.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/DMC:PC (1.5:1) solutions, the intensity ratios are found to be 0.69 and 0.71, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10–12</xref>). Our observation that the ratio of cross peak intensity to the geometric mean value of the two diagonal peak intensities does not strongly depend on the solvent composition suggests that the chemical exchange timescale in LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/DEC solution is quantitatively similar to that in mixed solvents consisting of DMC and PC.
