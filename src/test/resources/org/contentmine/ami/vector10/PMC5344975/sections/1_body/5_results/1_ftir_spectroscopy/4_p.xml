<p>To gain more insight into the vibrational properties of DEC···Li
 <sup>+</sup>:PF
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> as compared to DEC···Li
 <sup>+</sup>, we further analysed density functional theory calculation results of DEC interacting with Li
 <sup>+</sup>:PF

 <sup>−</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Even in the case of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in Li
 <sup>+</sup>:PF
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, still the carbonyl oxygen atom of DEC is the binding site forming C=O···Li
 <sup>+</sup>:PF
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> complex, though the C=O frequency red shift in that case is a bit smaller than that of C=O···Li
 <sup>+</sup>. If the first solvation shell structure around free Li
 <sup>+</sup> is spectroscopically different from that around Li
 <sup>+</sup>:PF
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, one might expect to see clear signature, that is, a new third infrared absorption band or shoulder in the lower-frequency region. A careful examination of the C=O band of LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> DEC solution, where the total C=O stretch infrared band was corrected by subtracting that of pure DEC liquid, shows no discernible spectroscopic feature of DEC-CIP (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, it is concluded that the carbonyl stretch infrared band consists of indistinguishable contributions from both C=O···Li
 <sup>+</sup> and C=O···Li
 <sup>+</sup>:PF
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> complexes, which altogether will be referred to as Li–DEC complex.
