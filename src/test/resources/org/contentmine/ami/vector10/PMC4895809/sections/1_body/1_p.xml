<p>Even though widely used, current commercial lithium-ion batteries containing a graphite anode have limited specific capacity and energy density in both portable and transportation applications
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Thus, new, low cost, safe anode materials with higher cycling capacity and power capability are urgently needed. In past decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to searching for superior anode materials, such as lithiated carbons, Si/Sn-based materials, Ti-based oxides and other metal oxides/sulfides/nitrides/fluorides/phosphides

The mechanism of Li reactivity of metal oxides differs from the classic Li-intercalation or Li-alloying processes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The metal oxides are reduced to metal nanoparticles through a conversion reaction that involves the formation of Li
