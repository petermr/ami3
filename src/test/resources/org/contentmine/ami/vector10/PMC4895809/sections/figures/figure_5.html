 <caption> Electrochemical characterization of nanocomposite anodes in half-cells. Voltage profiles ( a), cycle performance ( b) and rate performance ( c) for CNE, CCNE and CNNE samples based on the grid substrate. (In this and subsequent figures, all specific capacities of CCNEs are based on the total mass of the active materials contain CuO and CN x in the coreâ€“shell structure). </caption>
