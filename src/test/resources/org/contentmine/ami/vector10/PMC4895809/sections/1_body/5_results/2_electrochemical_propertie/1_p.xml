<p>The battery performance of our hierarchical structured electrode is evaluated by galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling of the 2025 coin-type cells. Half-cells with a metallic Li counter electrode are used to evaluate electrochemical properties of these nanocomposite electrodes. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, the cells are run at a current density of 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>; the CNE, CCNE, and CNNE based on grid substrates deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1234.8, 1164.8 and 1355.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. In the next cycle, the reversible discharge capacity of the CNE, CCNE and CNNE is 692.9, 803.6 and 801.8 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, with capacity retention of 56.2, 69.0 and 59.1%, respectively. These results suggest that the CuO core and CN

 </sub> shell in the nanocables both provide deintercalation capacity, and that the CCNE with core–shell architecture exhibits the highest reversible capacity and capacity retention. The extra capacity above the theoretical value of CuO (670 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) is believed to be due to the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte and subsequent formation of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, which are inferred from cyclic voltammetry (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). The SEI layers covering the surface of active nanocomposites prevent further reaction between the components of the electrolyte and the active materials
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, note that there is a large initial capacity loss, especially for the CNE and CNNE, which is due to the high surface areas of nanowire arrays. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref> shows the cycle performance over 200 cycles of different nanocomposite electrodes based on the grid substrate. From the 2nd to the 200th cycle, their capacity retention is 44.0, 83.3 and 73.8%, respectively. After 200 cycles, the CCNE still delivers a high capacity of 669.0 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is almost twice the theoretical capacity of graphite and also higher than that of the CNE (305.1 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and CNNE (592.1 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Also note that the coulombic efficiency of the CCNE rapidly increases to ca. 99% after the first 5 cycles, and remains stable throughout the cycles, indicating that the SEI layers remain intact, allowing reversible cycling after the surface reactions are completed. This result suggests that the CCNE shows the highest reversible capacity and the best cycle performance, indicating electrochemical reversibility and structural stability. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> shows rate performance versus cycle life. In general, the capacity retention of all electrodes decreases with increasing current density from 50 to 2500, mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Compared with the CNE, the CCNE and CNNE show better stability on cycling at each current rate, and almost recover their original capacity values when the current density is restored to 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. At the current density of 2,500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the CNE, CCNE and CNNE deliver an average discharge capacity of 230.5, 553.7 and 500.3 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The rate performance exhibited, particularly by CCNE, is excellent for a metal oxide anode. This finding reveals that the CCNE shows good charge transfer kinetics and stable structural integrity. The reductive CNNE also exhibits good electrochemical performance as a promising carbon-nitride candidate for anode materials. It is likely that the high N doping in the CN

 </sub> layer (∼20 at%, in this work) creates abundant defects that are well known to increase the capacity of the engineered carbon for their fast reaction with lithium
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Moreover, the N doping can also enhance the electronic conductivity, which additionally contributes to the exceptional rate performance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. However, initial coulomic efficiency and cyclability is poorer in CNNE than in CCNE, mainly due to the morphological/structural changes during the thermal reduction, which yield higher surface areas and reduce the structural stability of the CNNE (
