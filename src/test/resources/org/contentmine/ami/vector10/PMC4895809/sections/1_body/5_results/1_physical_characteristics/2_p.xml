<p>The morphologies of CNEs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and CCNEs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) prepared using different copper substrates are also observed by s.e.m. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a–c</xref> are the optical photos of CCNE films with diameters of 1.0 cm based on foil, net and grid substrates, respectively. The surfaces of the copper substrates are tarnished after heat treatment in O
 <sub>2</sub> at 600 °C followed by graphite deposition in N
 <sub>2</sub> for 40 min. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3d–f</xref> show the corresponding s.e.m. images, which display the 3D nano-architectures of high-density wire-like nanostructures over the entire surfaces of these substrates. Among these substrates, the nanostructures grown on the inner edges of the nets and ridges of the grids appear to be much denser and longer than those grown on the surface of the foils. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3g–i</xref> exhibit high-magnification s.e.m. images, which confirm a uniform diameter of 300−400 nm for these wire-like nanostructures. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3j</xref> illustrates the 3D nano-architectural models of these CCNEs.
