 <caption> Schematic of 3D arrays with the core–shell nano-architectural design. ( a) The typical two-step electrode design consisting of the oxide growth of CuO nanowires onto a copper net substrate followed by radio-frequency magnetrson sputtering of CN x films, forming a binder-free 3D array with core–shell nano-architecture. ( b) Theoretical structural modelling showing the micro-mechanism of CNE, CCNE and CNNE formation. </caption>
