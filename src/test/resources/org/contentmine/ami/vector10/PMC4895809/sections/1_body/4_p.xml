<p>Among metal oxides, copper oxide (CuO) has received attention owing to its advantages of high theoretical capacity (670 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>), low cost, facile synthesis and environmental benignity

Here, we rationally design a freestanding, three-dimensional (3D) sandwich-type composite electrode based on CuO/carbon-nitride (CN

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. Nanowire arrays of CuO are obtained through the oxidation of copper substrates (foil, grid and net), followed by deposition of ultrathin CN
