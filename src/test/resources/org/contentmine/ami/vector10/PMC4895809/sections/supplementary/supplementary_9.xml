  <title>Supplementary Movie 1</title>
  <p>In-situ TEM time-lapse movie of a single-sided coating CuO/CN
   <sub>x</sub> nanocable during the first lithiation process. Movie shows progressive lithiation mainly along the axial direction of the nanocable and morphological stability during lithiation. Curvature of nanocable is a result of the stable CN
   <sub>x</sub> shell resisting the large volume expansion of CuO core.
