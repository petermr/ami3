<p>The 3D nanoscale morphologies of CNE, CCNE and CNNE grown on copper foil are observed by s.e.m. and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–e</xref>, it is obvious that a high density of uniform CuO nanowires, with diameters in the range of 50−100 nm and lengths of 10−20 um, grows vertically onto the substrate. Similarly, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> dense array of uniform CuO/CN

 </sub> film after 40 min sputtering is ∼140 nm, with a deposition rate of 3.5 nm min
 <sup>−1</sup>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>. After the reduction, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, the entire surface of the substrate is still covered by a high density of Cu/CN

 </sub> nanocables. The shape change is mainly caused by the volume decrease that occurred during the reduction of wire-like CuO cores into copper nanoparticles, forming new hollow Cu/CN

 </sub> nanocables, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>. The entire process of oxidation, deposition and reduction of these nanosubstrates is illustrated in
