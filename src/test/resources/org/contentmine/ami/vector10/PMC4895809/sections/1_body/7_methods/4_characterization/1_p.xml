<p>The s.e.m. investigations were performed on a FEI QUANTA-250 operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The TEM observations were conducted with a JEOL-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV and a JEM-ARM200F microscope equipped with an EDX energy-dispersive spectrometer. The XRD patterns were recorded using a Rigaku Ultima IV-185 X-ray diffractometer (Cu-K
