In tracking experiments conducted in an orchard (established in 1996), the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker method was employed to know soil microbial system. Total PLFAs concentration did not vary significantly between soil depths but changed between seasons. It peaked in the summer at 258.97 ± 23.48 μg g-1 soil from 0-5 cm and at 270.99 ± 58.94 μg g-1 soil from 5-20 cm. A total of 33 microbial fatty acid biomarkers were observed and identified in the sampled soil. Quantities of PLFAs for 29 microbe groups varied significantly between seasons, except for 15:0 iso 3OH, 15:1 iso G, 16:0 2OH, and 17:0 iso 3OH. The bacterial PLFAs and fungal and actinomycotic PLFAs in the orchard soil collected in Summer were significantly higher than in the Spring or Autumn ( P &lt;; 0.01). The number of soil microorganism species (Richness) and the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were all the highest in summer. The total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, actinomycotic PLFAs, Richness, or the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were all significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, total carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) ( P &lt;; 0.05)."/>

    <h2 class="">Introduction</h2>
    <p id="p-3">The orchard ecosystem is important for fruit production and carbon sequestration, biodiversity decreases [
     <a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>] and soil erosion [
     <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>], and pollution [
     <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>,
     <a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>]. Hence, maintaining a balanced orchard ecosystem is essential. Soil microbes are essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems because they play a unique and indispensable role in ecosystem balance [
     <a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>].
    </p>
    <p id="p-4">Soil microbial community change by soil quality evolution because of long-term management. The interaction between microbes and soil quality is very complex. It is reflected in effects on microbial diversity of chemical properties change [
     <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>–
     <a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a>]. Spatial and temporal distribution of microbial community have some value information to explain the interaction [
     <a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12</a>–
     <a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>]. However, few clear information had be found by observation on spatial and temporal distribution of microbial community in subtropical orchard.
    </p>
    <p id="p-5">Thus, we hypothesized that height seasonal temperature and moisture variation and vertical soil chemical properties change would lead to obvious differences in spatial and temporal distribution of microbial community in subtropical orchard. To demonstrate seasonal and vertical changes in microbial diversity and the links between soil microbial diversity and soil chemical properties in a subtropical orchard, PLFA was employed to monitor microorganism quantity and diversity in orchard soils under different seasons in the hilly red soil of the subtropical zone in southern China. The observations of this study regarding ecological parameters of orchard soil microorganisms can provide a scientific basis for further studies and management strategies.</p>

     <h3>2.1. Experiment Area</h3>
     <p id="p-6">The experimental area was located at the Yuchi Village Experimental Station, Xicheng Township, Youxi County, Fujian Province, southeast China (26° 25’ N, 117°57’ E). The area has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an actual annual sunshine time of 1781.7 h (accounting for 40% of the available annual sunshine hours); an annual precipitation of 1,284 mm (
      <a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>); an annual average temperature of 19.2°C; an average temperature in July of 26.6°-28.9°C and in January of 8.0°-12.0°C; and a frost-free period of more than 312 d. As an peach orchard water and soil conservation monitoring system, the experimental station was established in 1996 with an altitude of 150 m and a slope of 15° facing south-southeast. The soil was a Quaternary age red soil with a clay soil texture [
      <a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">19</a>]. The experimental field was originally the secondary shrub-barren hill, and the constructive plant species were 
      <em>Dicranopteris dichotoma</em> Bernh, 
      <em>Miscanthus floridulus</em> War ex Schum, and 
      <em>M. sinensis</em> Anderss. The surrounding vegetation was mainly coniferous and coniferous-deciduous-bamboo mixed stands with constructive species of 
      <em>Pinus massoniana</em> Lamb and 
      <em>Cunninghamia lanceolata</em> Hook and a grove of 
      <em>Phyllostachys heterocycla</em> cv. Pubescens. The station was initially established for fixed soil erosion monitoring.

     <h3>2.2. Soil sampling</h3>
     <p id="p-8">Spring, Summer and Autumn as main treatments had been settled for seasonal factors. On April 27, August 22, and November 4, 2010, at 3 days (d) after raining to keep soil moisture at the same level, soils were sampled from three random spots in the non-fertilizing zones of the area surrounding the average tree were collected from the soil depths of 0-5 and 5-20 cm. The soil temperature before sampling was listed in 
      <a id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" class="xref-table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, with average temperature in Spring of 21.3°-22.0°C, Summer of 27.0°-28.0°C and Autumn of 18.0°-20.2°C. The air moisture tested in the same time was 82% for Spring, 86% for Summer, and 82.6% for Autumn. After collection, the soils from the same soil layer were mixed well in the field, sealed in bags, and immediately brought to the laboratory for measurement or stored in a −80°C freezer for soil microbial analysis. Other mixed soil samples were brought to the laboratory for water content test and air-dried for basic chemical properties analysis.

     <h3>2.4. Extraction and determination of microbial PLFAs</h3>
     <p id="p-11">Four steps followed for soil PLFA extraction: 1). Five grams of soil was placed in a centrifuge tube. Then, 15 mL of a 0.2 M KOH (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and methanol (Fisher Scientific Worldwide (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) solution was added before tightening the cap. The centrifuge tube was shaken for 5 min at 100 rpm. After shaking, the tube was incubated in a CU600 thermostat water bath for 5 min at 37°C. This procedure was repeated five times to help release the fatty acids from the soil sample. 2). Then, the tube was opened, and 3 mL of 1.0 M acetic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) solution was added to decrease the pH of the reaction. 3). After adding 10 mL of n-hexane (Merck Co., Darmstadt, German) and mixing well, the tubes were centrifuged in an N00077 centrifuge for 15 min using the following settings: rotor: #12,150; speed: 2000 rpm; time: 15 min; and temperature: 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant n-hexane was transferred to a clean flask and air-dried under a fan. 4). The air-dried sample was re-suspended in 0.5 mL of a mixture of n-hexane:methyl-tert-butyl ether (Tedia Co., Inc., Fairfield, OH) (1:1, v/v) for 3-5 min and transferred to gas chromatography (GC) vials for PLFA determination.</p>

     <h3>3.3. Microbial Diversity Change between Seasons in the Trial Orchard</h3>
     <p id="p-24">The microbial diversity analysis of the orchard soil showed that the Richness (number of microbial species) was in the range of 18 to 31, and the Simpson index, Shannon-Wiener index and Alatalo index were 0.76 to 0.93, 3.16 to 3.97 and 0.59 to 0.76, respectively (
      <a id="xref-fig-2-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). The microbial diversities of the orchard soil in different seasons varied. In the 0-5 cm soil depth, the Richness and the Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and Alatalo indexes peaked in the Summer, with values of 30.0, 0.92, 3.91 and 0.65, respectively. The Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes in the Summer were significantly different from those in the Spring and Autumn (
      <em>P</em> &lt;; 0.05). A significantly difference in Richness was been found between the Summer and Spring. No significant difference in the Alatalo index between seasons was found (
      <em>P</em> &gt;; 0.05). In the 5-20 cm soil layer, the highest values of Richness and the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener index were still been found in the Summer, with values of 29.2, 0.92 and 3.81, respectively. The Richness and the Simpson index of the soil microbes in the Summer were significantly higher than those in the Spring (
      <em>P</em> &lt;; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the Shannon-Wiener index. However, the Alatalo index of the soil microbes in the Autumn (0.76) was significantly higher than that in the Spring (0.62) (
      <em>P</em> &lt;; 0.05). Overall, the microbial diversity of the orchard soil in the Summer was higher than in the Spring and Autumn.

     <h3>4.1. Microbial Population Variation of Soil Ecosystem Among Seasons</h3>
     <p id="p-28">Usually, microbial population varies by moisture and temperature change among seasons. However, whether this change could be found easily depend on how long the suitable season last and how hard the extreme water and temperature condition affect on soil microorganisms. In subtropical mountain area, the soil was utilized as planting peach, obvious microbial change was confirmed in this article. And, principal component 1 explained 46.8 % of the variation in the soil microbial community (
      <a id="xref-fig-3-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). The total, bacterial, fungal, and actinomycotic PLFAs, the B/F ratio, and the Richness were the main drivers of principal component 1 (
      <a id="xref-table-wrap-7-1" class="xref-table" href="#T7">Table S1</a>). The remarkable change in microbial community was related to the peak soil microorganism growth in the Summer because of comfortable temperature and rainfall.

This difference is related to the particularly dry climate (drier than the long-term average of the season) with a significantly lower moisture content than in the Spring and Autumn.

     <h3>4.2. Relationship between Soil Physicochemical Properties and Microbial Communities</h3>
     <p id="p-32">The reported relationship between soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities varies among studies. In this study, in the view of distribution among seasons and soil depths, the total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, actinomycotic PLFAs, number of species (Richness), Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indexes were significantly negatively correlated with the soil TOC, TN and CEC. In the Summer, of most soil microbes experienced rapid growth, and a significant decrease in the soil pH, TOC, TN, and CEC was found (
      <a id="xref-table-wrap-1-2" class="xref-table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Liu et al. [
      <a id="xref-ref-18-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>] also found the microbial dominance index and Shannon-Wiener index to be negatively related to soil NH

      <sup>+</sup>-N and NO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>-</sup>-N in an apple system by observation on different growing periods. However, in the view of change by utilization, Yao et al. [
      <a id="xref-ref-6-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>] illustrated microbial biomass C, basal respiration and total PLFA to be highly correlated with organic C and TN on red soil orchard ecosystem. In some ecosystem soil microbes grew rapidly with energy and nutrition consumption [

      <a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>]. It is clearly suggested that the propagation and growth of soil microorganisms from Spring to Summer require energy from TOC and nutrition from N in an subtropical orchard system. Microbes mainly act as “consumers” could be well documented.

    <h2 class="">Conclusions</h2>
    <p id="p-33">In subtropical orchards, the temperature and humidity in the Summer are conducive to the growth of soil microorganisms. PLFA analysis showed that the quantity of soil microbes in the soil samples collected in the Summer was significantly higher than in the Spring and Autumn. The Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indices also both peaked in the Summer sample collections. The total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, actinomycotic PLFAs, Richness, and the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were significantly negatively correlated with seasonal changes in the soil pH, TOC, TN and CEC.</p>
    <p id="p-34">The function of microbial community in the translation and accumulation of soil nutrition from Summer to Autumn should be studied further. The changes in functional flora (including Archaea) in the soil microorganisms resulting from different orchard management strategies merit further investigations, and the relationships between the flora change and the orchard litter, soil organic matter (SOM), soil C/N ratio, ammonia N, nitrate N, pH, soil respiration, and other parameters should be merited further studied.</p>
