  <meta name="twitter:description" content="The flavours of foods and beverages are formed by the agricultural environment where the plants are grown. In the case of wine, the location and environmental features of the vineyard site imprint the wine with distinctive aromas and flavours. Microbial growth and metabolism play an integral role in wine production from the vineyard to the winery, by influencing grapevine health, wine fermentation, and the flavour, aroma and quality of finished wines. The mechanism by which microbial distribution patterns drive wine metabolites is unclear and while flavour has been correlated with bacterial composition for red wines, bacterial activity provides a minor biochemical conversion in wine fermentation. Here, we collected samples across six distinct winegrowing areas in southern Australia to investigate regional distribution patterns of both yeasts and bacteria and how this corresponds with wine aroma compounds. Results show that soil and must microbiota distinguish winegrowing regions and are related to wine chemical profiles. We found a strong relationship between microbial and wine metabolic profiles, and this relationship was maintained despite differing abiotic drivers (soil properties and weather/ climatic measures). Notably, fungal communities played the principal role in shaping wine aroma profiles and regional distinctiveness. We found that the soil microbiome is a potential source of grape- and must-associated fungi, and therefore the weather and soil conditions could influence the wine characteristics via shaping the soil fungal community compositions. Our study describes a comprehensive scenario of wine microbial biogeography in which microbial diversity responds to surrounding environments and ultimately sculpts wine aromatic characteristics. These findings provide perspectives for thoughtful human practices to optimise food and beverage flavour and composition through understanding of fungal activity and abundance."/>

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="The flavours of foods and beverages are formed by the agricultural environment where the plants are grown. In the case of wine, the location and environmental features of the vineyard site imprint the wine with distinctive aromas and flavours. Microbial growth and metabolism play an integral role in wine production from the vineyard to the winery, by influencing grapevine health, wine fermentation, and the flavour, aroma and quality of finished wines. The mechanism by which microbial distribution patterns drive wine metabolites is unclear and while flavour has been correlated with bacterial composition for red wines, bacterial activity provides a minor biochemical conversion in wine fermentation. Here, we collected samples across six distinct winegrowing areas in southern Australia to investigate regional distribution patterns of both yeasts and bacteria and how this corresponds with wine aroma compounds. Results show that soil and must microbiota distinguish winegrowing regions and are related to wine chemical profiles. We found a strong relationship between microbial and wine metabolic profiles, and this relationship was maintained despite differing abiotic drivers (soil properties and weather/ climatic measures). Notably, fungal communities played the principal role in shaping wine aroma profiles and regional distinctiveness.

                            <p id="p-2">The flavours of foods and beverages are formed by the agricultural environment where the plants are grown. In the case of wine, the location and environmental features of the vineyard site imprint the wine with distinctive aromas and flavours. Microbial growth and metabolism play an integral role in wine production from the vineyard to the winery, by influencing grapevine health, wine fermentation, and the flavour, aroma and quality of finished wines. The mechanism by which microbial distribution patterns drive wine metabolites is unclear and while flavour has been correlated with bacterial composition for red wines, bacterial activity provides a minor biochemical conversion in wine fermentation. Here, we collected samples across six distinct winegrowing areas in southern Australia to investigate regional distribution patterns of both yeasts and bacteria and how this corresponds with wine aroma compounds. Results show that soil and must microbiota distinguish winegrowing regions and are related to wine chemical profiles. We found a strong relationship between microbial and wine metabolic profiles, and this relationship was maintained despite differing abiotic drivers (soil properties and weather/ climatic measures). Notably, fungal communities played the principal role in shaping wine aroma profiles and regional distinctiveness. We found that the soil microbiome is a potential source of grape- and must-associated fungi, and therefore the weather and soil conditions could influence the wine characteristics via shaping the soil fungal community compositions. Our study describes a comprehensive scenario of wine microbial biogeography in which microbial diversity responds to surrounding environments and ultimately sculpts wine aromatic characteristics. These findings provide perspectives for thoughtful human practices to optimise food and beverage flavour and composition through understanding of fungal activity and abundance.</p>
