<meta name="DC.Description" content="Soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria , and razor clams, Tagelus plebeius , in Chesapeake Bay have declined since the 1970s, with severe declines since the 1990s. These declines are likely caused by multiple factors including warming, predation, habitat loss, recruitment limitation, disease, and harvesting. A bivalve survey in Chesapeake Bay examined influential factors on bivalve populations, focusing on predation (crabs, fish, and cownose rays), habitat (mud, sand, gravel, shell, or seagrass), environment (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen), recruitment, and disease. M. arenaria and T. plebeius were found more often in habitats with complex physical structures (seagrass, shell) than any other habitat. Pulses in bivalve density associated with recruitment were attenuated through the summer and fall when predators are most active, indicating that predators likely influence temporal dynamics in these species. Presence of Mya arenaria, which is near the southern extent of its range in Chesapeake Bay, was negatively correlated with water temperature. Recruitment of M. arenaria in Rhode River, MD, declined between 1980 and 2016. Infection by the parasitic protist Perkinsus sp. was associated with stressful environmental conditions, bivalve size, and environmental preferences of Perkinsus sp, but was not associated with bivalve densities. It is likely that habitat loss, low recruitment, and predators are major factors keeping T. plebeius and M. arenaria at low densities in Chesapeake Bay. Persistence at low densities may be facilitated by habitat complexity (presence of physical structures), whereas further reductions in habitats such as seagrass and shell hash could result in local extinction of these important bivalve species." />

<meta name="twitter:description" content="Soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria , and razor clams, Tagelus plebeius , in Chesapeake Bay have declined since the 1970s, with severe declines since the 1990s. These declines are likely caused by multiple factors including warming, predation, habitat loss, recruitment limitation, disease, and harvesting. A bivalve survey in Chesapeake Bay examined influential factors on bivalve populations, focusing on predation (crabs, fish, and cownose rays), habitat (mud, sand, gravel, shell, or seagrass), environment (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen), recruitment, and disease. M. arenaria and T. plebeius were found more often in habitats with complex physical structures (seagrass, shell) than any other habitat. Pulses in bivalve density associated with recruitment were attenuated through the summer and fall when predators are most active, indicating that predators likely influence temporal dynamics in these species. Presence of Mya arenaria, which is near the southern extent of its range in Chesapeake Bay, was negatively correlated with water temperature. Recruitment of M. arenaria in Rhode River, MD, declined between 1980 and 2016. Infection by the parasitic protist Perkinsus sp. was associated with stressful environmental conditions, bivalve size, and environmental preferences of Perkinsus sp, but was not associated with bivalve densities. It is likely that habitat loss, low recruitment, and predators are major factors keeping T. plebeius and M. arenaria at low densities in Chesapeake Bay. Persistence at low densities may be facilitated by habitat complexity (presence of physical structures), whereas further reductions in habitats such as seagrass and shell hash could result in local extinction of these important bivalve species." />

In Chesapeake Bay, <em>M. arenaria</em> has supported a commercial hydraulic dredge fishery in Virginia and Maryland starting in the early 1950s with the invention of the hydraulic dredge. Commercial clammers also harvest <em>T. plebeius</em> for eel and crab bait (<a id="xref-ref-25-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">Dungan et al. 2002</a>, <a id="xref-ref-45-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">Homer et al. 2011</a>).</p><p id="p-6">Historically, <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> served important roles as biomass dominants that contributed substantially to the food web and water quality of Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">Abraham &amp; Dillon 1986</a>, <a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">Eggleston et al. 1992</a>, <a id="xref-ref-86-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-86">Seitz et al. 2001</a>). <em>Mya arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> are key prey for numerous commercially and recreationally important fish and crab species (<a id="xref-ref-27-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">Eggleston et al. 1992</a>, <a id="xref-ref-88-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-88">Seitz et al. 2005</a>, <a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-30">Fisher 2010</a>). These large-bodied filter-feeding clams likely played a large role in filtration of the water column when they were abundant; <em>M. arenaria</em> in the Baltic Sea can filter the entire water column in less than a day (<a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-32">Forster &amp; Zettler 2004</a>), and filtration by <em>M. arenaria</em> in the Gulf of Maine increased water clarity in some lagoons where their densities were high (<a id="xref-ref-95-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-95">Thiet et al. 2014</a>). Non-oyster bivalves have recently gained attention for water filtration as an ecosystem service in Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-34-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-34">Gedan et al. 2014</a>), but the value of filtration by thin-shelled clams has not been assessed.</p><p id="p-7">In Chesapeake Bay, <em>M. arenaria</em> has been in decline since the early 1970s, with more pronounced declines since the 1990s, and this species now exists in Chesapeake Bay at record low levels (<a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Declines during and after 1972 are attributed to impacts from Tropical Storm Agnes, a 100-year storm that drastically reduced salinities and increased sedimentation throughout Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-48">Hyer &amp; Ruzecki 1976</a>, <a id="xref-ref-82-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-82">Schubel 1976</a>, <a id="xref-ref-83-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-83">Schubel et al. 1976</a>), which resulted in a mass mortality event for <em>M. arenaria</em> (<a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">Cory &amp; Redding 1976</a>). Due to this storm, which followed declines in abundance of <em>M. arenaria</em> in the late 1960s, the commercial hydraulic dredge fishery for <em>M. arenaria</em> essentially ended in Virginia waters around 1968, and has failed to recover since then (<a id="xref-ref-37-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-37">Haven, 1970</a>). More recent (post-1990) dramatic declines in abundance of <em>M. arenaria</em> have resulted in variable, low harvests in Maryland waters (<a id="xref-ref-45-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">Homer et al. 2011</a>). Since 1980, commercial clammers have gradually switched to harvest of <em>T. plebeius</em> for eel and crab pot bait (<a id="xref-ref-25-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">Dungan et al. 2002</a>, <a id="xref-ref-45-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">Homer et al. 2011</a>). Like <em>M. arenaria, T. plebeius</em> populations have experienced declines in recent years, which were first documented in 2003 and resulted in the loss of 70-80% of the population in Maryland (<a id="xref-fig-1-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>; <a id="xref-ref-45-5" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">Homer et al. 2011</a>). There are no historic landings records or long-term time series of <em>T. plebeius</em> abundance, so the history of decline and potential mechanisms for decline in this species are largely unknown.</p><div id="F1" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/02/25/224071/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="(a) Mya arenaria abundance (&#xB1; S.E.) and fishery landings (solid line) for the period 1951-2015, with inset showing amplification of abundance and landings for 2000-2015.

Some of these factors, in particular disease and overharvesting, have been blamed for the inability of <em>M. arenaria</em> to recover from Tropical Storm Agnes and the recent declines in <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> abundances (<a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-31">Fisher et al. 2011</a>, <a id="xref-ref-45-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">Homer et al. 2011</a>). Overharvesting is unlikely to be responsible for current trends in Chesapeake Bay clam densities because, as previously mentioned, fishing pressure is not consistent throughout the Bay. The role of the remaining factors in determining local or regional population dynamics of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> has yet to be determined.</p><p id="p-10">There is some evidence that habitat preferences, including availability of refuge habitat that allows clams to avoid predation, may influence population dynamics of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.</em> Habitat type has been shown to influence the distribution and abundances of <em>M. arenaria.</em> Growth rates can be impacted by sediment type, with higher growth rates observed in sand than mud-gravel-shell mixtures (<a id="xref-ref-66-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-66">Newell 1982</a>). Habitats with more structure, such as gravel, shell hash, or seagrass, can also provide refuge from predators (<a id="xref-ref-92-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-92">Sponaugle &amp; Lawton 1990</a>, <a id="xref-ref-89-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-89">Skilleter 1994</a>, <a id="xref-ref-86-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-86">Seitz et al. 2001</a>). The availability of some refuge habitats, such as seagrass and oyster shell, is decreasing in the Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-80-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-80">Rothschild et al. 1994</a>, <a id="xref-ref-56-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-56">Lefcheck et al. 2017</a>). The severe and persistent declines of Chesapeake Bay seagrass in the recent past have been attributed mostly to anthropogenic nutrient and sediment pollution, which decrease water clarity (<a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-50">Kemp et al. 2004</a>). The dominant seagrass species in Chesapeake Bay, eelgrass <em>Zostera marina,</em> is also sensitive to warming, and the interaction between warming and poor water quality has resulted in recent declines of shallow beds (<a id="xref-ref-56-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-56">Lefcheck et al. 2017</a>). In the past several years, seagrass die-offs induced by extreme high temperatures in Chesapeake Bay have resulted in the prediction that <em>Z. marina</em> may disappear from the Bay entirely (<a id="xref-ref-63-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-63">Moore &amp; Jarvis 2008</a>; though seagrass may be increasing in the coastal bays, see <a id="xref-ref-71-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-71">Orth &amp; McGlathery 2012</a>). Loss of oyster reefs in Chesapeake Bay due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and disease has resulted in the ecological extinction of oysters in the Bay (<a id="xref-ref-80-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-80">Rothschild et al. 1994</a>, <a id="xref-ref-97-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-97">Wilberg et al. 2011</a>). As oysters have been lost, so has a major source of shell material in the Bay. Oyster shell is a limited resource, and shell half-life is estimated to be as little as 3-10 years in Delaware Bay (<a id="xref-ref-60-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-60">Mann &amp; Powell 2007</a>). Loss of this structural refuge may have implications for populations of deep-burrowing clams such as <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.</em></p><p id="p-11">The recent findings of high prevalences of the parasitic protist <em>Perkinsus chesapeaki</em> in <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> suggest that this could be a cause of the population declines of both bivalve species (<a id="xref-ref-25-5" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">Dungan et al. 2002</a>, <a id="xref-ref-78-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-78">Reece et al. 2008</a>). <em>Perkinsus chesapeaki</em> infections have reached epizootic levels in <em>M. arenaria</em> (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29">Farley et al. 1991</a>, <a id="xref-ref-25-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">Dungan et al. 2002</a>, <a id="xref-ref-78-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-78">Reece et al. 2008</a>). However, prevalence is not necessarily equal to pathogenicity, as seen in some disease-resistant oyster stocks in the Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">Encomio et al. 2005</a>). The cancer disseminated neoplasia also causes mortality of <em>M. arenaria,</em> but this disease is not as prevalent as <em>P. chesapeaki,</em> and is not reported to affect <em>T. plebeius</em> (<a id="xref-ref-25-7" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">Dungan et al. 2002</a>); thus, the disease aspect of this study focuses only on the impact of <em>P. chesapeaki</em> on <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.</em></p><p id="p-12">Extreme temperature, dissolved oxygen, or salinity levels may be stressful to <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius,</em> resulting in mortality or metabolic constraints that make these conditions not suitable for growth. <em>Mya arenaria</em> is near the southern extent of its geographic range in Virginia, and is not tolerant of temperatures above 28°C, a temperature that is frequently exceeded in Chesapeake Bay during summer months (<a id="xref-ref-63-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-63">Moore &amp; Jarvis 2008</a>). In contrast, <em>T. plebeius</em> is a warm-water species that is distributed into South America (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">Abrahao et al. 2010</a>), and high water temperatures (above 28°C) may not be stressful for this species. Benthic species in general are intolerant of dissolved oxygen levels below 1.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (<a id="xref-ref-79-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-79">Rosenberg et al. 1991</a>), and<em>M. arenaria</em> will decrease burial depth and extend their siphons into the water column under severe hypoxia (&lt; 1.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) (<a id="xref-ref-93-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-93">Taylor &amp; Eggleston 2000</a>). Thus, low dissolved oxygen is likely to be stressful for both <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.</em> Finally, <em>T. plebeius</em> are rarely found at salinities under 5 ppt (<a id="xref-ref-44-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-44">Holland et al. 1987</a>), and<em>M. arenaria</em> are intolerant of salinities below 4 ppt (<a id="xref-ref-1-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">Abraham &amp; Dillon 1986</a>).</p><p id="p-13">Settlement and post-settlement processes are also important in determining distribution of organisms in soft-sediment communities (<a id="xref-ref-67-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-67">Olafsson et al. 1994</a>). Larval behavior, hydrodynamics, and intense predation of postlarval bivalves control patterns of <em>M. arenaria</em> recruitment in other systems (<a id="xref-ref-8-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">Beukema &amp; Dekker 2005</a>, <a id="xref-ref-13-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13">Bowen &amp; Hunt 2009</a>). Recruitment of <em>M. arenaria</em> remains high in several tributaries of Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-59-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-59">Lovall et al. 2017</a>) though these individuals rarely survive to adulthood, except in habitats with sufficient structure to allow protection from predators (<a id="xref-ref-88-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-88">Seitz et al. 2005</a>). Locally, recruitment of <em>M. arenaria</em> is not necessarily correlated with abundance of adult clams (<a id="xref-ref-13-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13">Bowen &amp; Hunt 2009</a>), but low densities of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> throughout the Chesapeake Bay may limit recruitment and contribute to the loss of these bivalve species, as seen in bay scallops <em>Argopecten irradians irradians</em> in Long Island Sound (<a id="xref-ref-94-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-94">Tettelbach et al. 2015</a>). In addition, larval and post-larval individuals of <em>M. arenaria</em> are more susceptible to extreme environmental conditions such as high temperatures and low salinities (<a id="xref-ref-1-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">Abraham &amp; Dillon 1986</a>), and population dynamics for this species may be controlled by this sensitive life stage.</p><p id="p-14">No single factor can likely be exclusively attributed to the declines of these two bivalve species; thus, multiple factors were considered to gain useful insight into the problem. In this study, we used field surveys to concurrently examine predation, habitat, recruitment, and disease prevalence/intensity to disentangle the relative effects of these factors on survival and persistence of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.</em> We hypothesized that: (1) densities of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> are positively associated with presence of complex habitat such as seagrass and shell, and negatively correlated with predator densities; (2) densities of <em>M. arenaria</em> are negatively correlated with temperature; and (3) intensity and prevalence of infection by presumed <em>Perkinsus chesapeaki</em> (hereafter, <em>Perkinsus</em> sp.) increase under stressful environmental conditions (i.e., positively correlated with temperature and river discharge, negatively correlated with salinity and dissolved oxygen).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2 class="">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><h3>Study system</h3><p id="p-15">The Chesapeake Bay provides an ideal location to study the effects of predators, habitat type, recruitment, disease, and physical factors on the distribution and abundance of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.</em> The Bay offers a range of environmental conditions including temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and availability of complex habitat. Lower Chesapeake Bay (the Virginia portion of Chesapeake Bay) is mostly polyhaline (except in the upper reaches of the tributaries). Upper Chesapeake Bay (the Maryland portion of the Bay) is mostly mesohaline. Bottom habitat type in the upper Bay is characterized by oyster shell hash, soft muds, fine sands, and gravel/pebbles (<a id="xref-ref-91-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-91">Smith et al. 2003</a>). Bottom type in the lower Bay is similar to that of the upper Bay (<a id="xref-ref-99-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-99">Wright et al. 1987</a>), except shallow shoals in the lower Bay south of the Potomac River often have mixed beds of eelgrass <em>Z. marina</em> and widgeongrass <em>Ruppia maritima</em> (<a id="xref-ref-70-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-70">Orth et al. 2010</a>).

Replicate sample locations in each site were selected by throwing the suction cylinder from the boat, and samples were sieved through 3-mm mesh. All samples were assigned a habitat category (mud, sand, gravel, shell, or seagrass) based on observations made in the field and the lab during sample processing. In the upper Bay, due to the low density of clams and a lack of seagrass in clam habitat, samples were collected using a commercial hydraulic escalator dredge targeting areas fished for <em>M. arenaria.</em> This method of collection was not used in the lower Bay to prevent unnecessary destruction of existing seagrass beds, and because clams were consistently captured using less destructive methods such as suction sampling. Habitats were categorized by the presence/absence of oyster shell hash retained on the escalator dredge, and by diver surveys conducted in 2012. All <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> were counted, and clam densities at each site were determined by sample area (in lower Bay) or dredge distance (in upper Bay). All clams were measured to the nearest 1 mm for shell length. Bottom (e.g. &lt; 1 m from the sediment surface) dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were also recorded at each site using a YSI (Model 85, Yellow Springs Instruments).</p><p id="p-20">Between spring 2012 and summer 2013, blue crab abundance was quantified at each lower Bay site within a few days of bivalve suction sampling using six replicate 20-m tows of a modified commercial crab scrape (usually used for harvesting soft-shell peeler crabs in seagrass in lower Chesapeake Bay; 6 mm mesh, 1 m width; <a id="xref-ref-87-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-87">Seitz et al., 2008</a>) because it is effective sampling mobile fauna in seagrass. In the upper Bay, seagrass was not a concern and two replicate 4.9 m-wide otter trawl tows were conducted at each site in the spring, summer, and fall of 2012 for seven minutes each (approx.∼ 500 m). Gear efficiencies of both methods are similar: 24-34% for capture of juvenile crabs with the crab scrape (<a id="xref-ref-75-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-75">Ralph 2014</a>) and ∼22% for capture of most predators, including fish and crabs, with the otter trawl (<a id="xref-ref-46-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-46">Homer et al. 1980</a>). Any fish caught in tows were counted and released. A fish species list and number caught can be found in <a id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" class="xref-table" href="#T3">Supplemental Table 1</a>. Approximately 10% of bivalve sampling events were paired with trawls that occurred approximately a month before or after bivalve sampling, due to logistical constraints. In this case, an average of crab or fish abundance before and after the bivalve sampling was used in analyses. At each bivalve sampling site and for each season, the number of ray pits within 1 m to either side of a 50-m transect were counted, and are treated as a proxy of cownose ray density (<a id="xref-ref-41-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-41">Hines et al. 1997</a>). Ray pits were about 0.3 m in diameter and 10 cm deep, and could be easily seen in good visibility, or detected by sweeping the sediment with hands in poor visibility. Horseshoe crabs were not quantified because they were not abundant enough in any of our samples. Fish and crab abundances per tow and ray pit counts were converted to density per 100 m<sup>2</sup> for analyses. Due to logistical constraints, certain data, such as environmental data and predator abundance, were missing from the survey dataset, especially for fall 2011, so models that included these missing variables were fit to data from spring 2012 through fall 2013. Environmental data from the CBIBS monitoring buoy at 38.963N 76.448W were used for Maryland western shore samples from summer and fall 2013.</p><p id="p-21">We conducted a gear comparison of bivalve sampling methods by using suction samples collected in the same areas as hydraulic dredging in spring 2012. Site-average densities from suction samples were regressed against site-average densities from hydraulic dredging for both <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius.

Biomass of both <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> from the lower Bay was determined as ash free dry weight of bivalves dried in a drying oven for 24 hours, and ashed in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for five hours; bivalves in the upper Bay were not processed for biomass.</p><p id="p-22">The long-term trend of <em>M. arenaria</em> recruitment in Maryland was evaluated using data from surveys conducted by SERC in the Rhode River, Maryland. Benthic core samples were collected approximately quarterly (typically March/April, June, October, December) at two sandy subtidal sites from 1981-2016. These sites were located at 38.885797N, 76.541790W and 38.868377N, 76.518276W. Cores were 10.2 cm in diameter and 35 cm long. Seven core samples were taken per site on each sample date and animals retained on a 500 μm sieve were preserved in 10% buffered formalin and stained with rose Bengal. All <em>M. arenaria</em> were measured for shell length and individuals &lt;10 mm shell length were considered recruits.

Densities of both <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> were associated with habitats with a high degree of complexity (seagrass and shell) as compared to some less-complex habitats (mud, sand, and gravel). Complex habitats may be more favorable for these species because they increase rates of larval settlement by baffling water currents (<a id="xref-ref-39-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39">Heiss et al. 2010</a>), provide increased food resources for both suspension and facultative deposit-feeding species (<a id="xref-ref-72-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-72">Peterson et al. 1984</a>), and provide refuge from predators (<a id="xref-ref-69-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-69">Orth et al. 1984</a>). However, this also implies that habitat loss may be an important factor in the decline of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius,</em> as both seagrass and oyster reef habitats are declining in Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-69-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-69">Orth et al. 1984</a>, <a id="xref-ref-68-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-68">2006</a>, <a id="xref-ref-80-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-80">Rothschild et al. 1994</a>, <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">Beck et al. 2011</a>, <a id="xref-ref-56-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-56">Lefcheck et al. 2017</a>).</p><p id="p-49">In agreement with our hypotheses, densities of <em>M. arenaria</em> were negatively associated with increasing temperature. <em>Mya arenaria</em> is a cold-water species that is distributed from the sub-arctic regions to North Carolina along Atlantic coasts of North America (<a id="xref-ref-1-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">Abraham &amp; Dillon 1986</a>, <a id="xref-ref-61-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-61">Maximovich &amp; Guerassimova 2003</a>). Typically <em>M. arenaria</em> survives well in temperatures from 2 to 28 °C (<a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">Cohen 2005</a>), with mortality usually occurring above 30 °C (<a id="xref-ref-52-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-52">Kennedy &amp; Mihursky 1971</a>). It is expected that with global climate change, Chesapeake Bay may become inhospitable for this species. The upper tolerance range for <em>M. arenaria</em> is frequently surpassed in the summer in Chesapeake Bay, especially in shallow waters where this sampling effort took place. High summer temperatures in particular are likely a factor in the decline of <em>M. arenaria</em> in lower Chesapeake Bay.</p><p id="p-50">Bivalve presence/absence and density were not negatively associated with ray, blue crab, or fish densities for either species, in contrast to our hypothesis, and horseshoe crabs were not abundant enough to determine their relative contribution to bivalve mortality. However, the snapshot in time provided by our predator and bivalve sampling may not reflect the legacy of predator-prey interactions experienced by local clam populations (<a id="xref-ref-96-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-96">Thrush et al. 1997</a>, <a id="xref-ref-84-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-84">Seitz &amp; Lipcius 2001</a>, Seitz et al. 2016). Our seasonal time series for <em>M. arenaria</em> abundance in particular seem to indicate that predation is an important factor in determining density. In both the upper and lower Bay, densities of <em>M. arenaria</em> decline throughout the summer months when predation peaks (<a id="xref-ref-40-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-40">Hines et al. 1990</a>). Observed temporal trends also correspond with <em>M. arenaria</em> reproductive behavior in Chesapeake Bay, where the fall spawn is more successful than the spring spawn, due to decreased predation pressure in the winter months (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">Blundon &amp; Kennedy 1982a</a>, <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">Baker &amp; Mann 1991</a>). Individuals spawned in the fall are able to settle and grow throughout the winter, when risk of predation is minimal, and this new generation manifests as a springtime spike in density. However, even the clams that survive until the spring are almost completely consumed by predators each year, essentially resulting in an “annual crop” rather than a stable population with a sustainable age distribution. The declines in <em>M. arenaria</em> in summer may be associated with increasing temperature as well as predation, and we have insufficient evidence from our snapshot in time to distinguish between effects of the two. However, this effect persisted in both the upper and lower Bay, and under different temperature regimes, indicating that predation is likely a major driver of observed trends in <em>M. arenaria</em> density.</p><p id="p-51">Despite occupying a similar niche in Chesapeake Bay, <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> exhibited different seasonal trends in densities. <em>Tagelus plebeius</em> spawns in the spring (<a id="xref-ref-43-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-43">Holland &amp; Dean 1977</a>, <a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-23">da Silva et al. 2015</a>), and while a spring high-density event was noted in the upper Bay in 2012, the lower Bay had relatively steady densities that did not show a clear recruitment signal or summer crash. <em>Tagelus plebeius</em> in the lower Bay likely do not exhibit the same seasonal crashes in abundance observed for <em>M. arenaria</em> because a robust adult <em>T. plebeius</em> population remains in lower Chesapeake Bay throughout the seasons. This population allows for high densities of many different size classes to exist at any given time. However, in the upper Bay, where densities are much lower, seasonal spring recruitment was evident in time series, indicating very different population dynamics in these two regions of Chesapeake Bay. <em>Tagelus plebeius</em> in the upper Bay seem to exhibit annual population fluctuations more similar to those of <em>M. arenaria.</em> This may be because of density-dependent mortality sources specific to the upper Bay, including fishing pressure and disease, which work to keep upper Bay <em>T. plebeius</em> at low densities that are sensitive to annual recruitment and predation.</p><p id="p-52">Predation and low fecundity likely drive patterns in recruitment of <em>M. arenaria</em> in Chesapeake Bay, which is characterized by very low recruitment with some pockets of locally high recruitment, though studies examining recruitment in more locations would be necessary to identify factors contributing to low recruitment. Although there are some cases of locally high recruitment of <em>M. arenaria</em> in Virginia (<a id="xref-ref-59-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-59">Lovall et al. 2017</a>), recruitment in the Rhode River, Maryland, declined drastically since the 1980s and now is essentially zero. Predation has been identified as the most important limiting factor in recruitment of <em>M. arenaria</em> in other regions (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">Beal et al. 2001</a>, <a id="xref-ref-47-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-47">Hunt &amp; Mullineaux 2002</a>, <a id="xref-ref-4-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">Beal 2006</a>), and likely plays an important role in Chesapeake Bay as well. In addition, low adult densities and small body sizes may limit recruitment, as fecundity increases exponentially with clam size (<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14">Brousseau 1978</a>, <a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">Brousseau &amp; Baglivo 1988</a>).</p><p id="p-53">In agreement with our hypothesis, <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infection intensity and prevalence in both species was positively associated with high temperatures, conditions that were considered stressful for <em>M. arenaria</em> in particular. Impacts of dissolved oxygen on <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infection were less clear, though dissolved oxygen was generally within the tolerable range for <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> (&gt; 1.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>; <a id="xref-ref-79-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-79">Rosenberg et al. 1991</a>, <a id="xref-ref-93-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-93">Taylor &amp; Eggleston 2000</a>), and may not have been extreme enough to induce a stress response during the course of the survey. Disease intensity and prevalence in <em>M. arenaria</em> was positively correlated with salinity, and long-term intensities and prevalences of <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infections in <em>M. arenaria</em> were negatively associated with Susquehanna River discharge, a proxy of salinity. Salinity preference of <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. may explain the long-term correlation between infection intensities/prevalences and river discharge/salinity. <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. survives and proliferates best at moderate to high salinities, depending on the species. At 28 °C, <em>Perkinsus chesapeaki</em> survival and proliferation is optimal at moderate salinities 15-25%<sub>0</sub> (La <a id="xref-ref-73-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-73">Peyre et al. 2006</a>) or 14 <em>%%</em> (<a id="xref-ref-62-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-62">McLaughlin et al. 2000</a>). In oysters, infection intensity and prevalence of a similar protist, <em>Perkinsus marinus,</em> were both greater in higher salinity waters (<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">Burreson &amp; Calvo 1996</a>). Thus, it may be expected that <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infection in <em>M. arenaria</em> would be greatest in high-salinity (low flow) years and locations.</p><p id="p-54">It is possible that disease dynamics do not drive trends in <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> density in space and time, as intensities of infections were generally low for both species. In addition, infection intensity was associated with clam size (proxy of age), but not with clam densities. Previous studies have also failed to find an association between <em>P. chesapeaki</em> infection and mortality (<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">Bushek et al. 2008</a>). However, this study was unable to disentangle the impact of disease on mortality (which would manifest as a negative relationship between bivalve density and disease) from density-dependent disease dynamics (which would manifest as a positive relationship between bivalve density and disease). To our knowledge, this study documents the most complete record of <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infection in <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> to date, but impacts of disease mortalities on depleted clam populations of Chesapeake Bay remain to be carefully evaluated by rigorous experimental investigations of disease pathogenesis and outcomes.</p><p id="p-55">Several major storms occurred during the study period, including Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in New Jersey on October 29, 2012 and caused major flooding throughout Chesapeake Bay (<a id="xref-ref-54-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-54">Kunz et al. 2013</a>), and Hurricane Lee in 2011, which was a major inflow event (<a id="xref-ref-42-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-42">Hirsch 2012</a>). In contrast to Tropical Storm Agnes, these storms produced no noticeable mortality in our survey of <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> in the Chesapeake Bay. Although some of these storms caused extensive loss of human life and damage to infrastructure (<a id="xref-ref-90-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-90">Smith &amp; Katz 2013</a>), benthic ecosystems may be largely resistant to such disturbances. However, extreme storms have caused mass mortality of bivalves (<a id="xref-ref-57-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-57">Lochead et al. 2012</a>, <a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-33">Freeman et al. 2013</a>), and it is possible that these storms did not produce environmental conditions severe enough to produce a response in the bivalves surveyed as part of this study.</p><p id="p-56">The lack of information on <em>T. plebeius</em> long-term abundances is an impediment to understanding the decline of this species and the consequences of this decline. Without landings records or fisheries-independent indices of <em>T. plebeius</em> abundance, it is difficult to assess the health of the population. In addition, basic population biology information for <em>T. plebeius</em> populations in the coastal U.S. is often lacking. Investigations of some populations of <em>T. plebeius</em> in Argentina (<a id="xref-ref-58-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-58">Lomovasky et al. 2016</a>) and Brazil (<a id="xref-ref-23-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-23">da Silva et al. 2015</a>) have established valuable baselines for the species. The ecological and commercial importance of this species, as well as its role harboring <em>Perkinsus</em> sp., warrant future studies on growth, reproduction, tolerance to environmental conditions, disease-related mortality, and distribution within U.S. waters.</p><div id="sec-11" class="subsection"><h3>Conclusions</h3><p id="p-57">It is likely that habitat loss, low recruitment, and predators are major factors keeping <em>Mya arenaria</em> and <em>Tagelus plebeius</em> at low densities in Chesapeake Bay, though continued harvest, which was not addressed in this study, may play a role as well. We found no evidence suggesting densities of <em>M. arenaria</em> or <em>T. plebeius</em> are negatively impacted by <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infection prevalence or intensity, though the direct effect of <em>Perkinsus</em> sp. infection on bivalve mortality remains to be addressed. Extremely low densities of <em>M. arenaria,</em> decimated after tropical storm Agnes in 1972 (<a id="xref-ref-21-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">Cory &amp; Redding 1976</a>, <a id="xref-ref-38-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-38">Haven et al. 1976</a>), and a susceptibility of this thin-shelled species to predation by blue crabs, likely fuel a feedback loop that leads to high per-capita rates of predation, which works to keep <em>M. arenaria</em> populations at low levels. In recent years, similar dynamics may have been at work in the upper Chesapeake Bay, where populations of <em>T. plebeius</em> have reached low densities through fishing pressure or possibly disease. Since <em>M. arenaria</em> and <em>T. plebeius</em> are preferred prey items for major predators such as <em>Callinectes sapidus</em> and <em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em> (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">Blundon and Kennedy, 1982b</a>; <a id="xref-ref-30-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-30">Fisher, 2010</a>), it is unlikely that predator switching will provide much relief. However, both species appear able to take advantage of refuge provided by complex habitats. Habitats such as seagrass and shell hash allow both bivalve species to persist at a low-density refuge, which may be stable. Further work should focus on predator-prey interactions, elucidating the existence and stability of low-density refuge habitats, the effect of population declines on ecosystem services such as filtration, and the likelihood that thin-shelled bivalve species may persist, recover, and sustain commercial fisheries in Chesapeake Bay.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-14"><h2 class="">SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES</h2><div id="F9" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/02/25/224071/F9.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="Relationship between density of (a) Mya arenaria and (b) Tagelus plebeius in suction samples and hydraulic dredge samples, including equations from simple linear regressions.
