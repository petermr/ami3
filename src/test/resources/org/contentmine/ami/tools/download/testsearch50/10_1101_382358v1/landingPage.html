<meta name="DC.Description" content="This study assessed households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks in Dinki watershed, northcentral highlands of Ethiopia. The data were collected through cross-sectional survey conducted on 288 households, six focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews. The Climate Resilience Index (CRI) and the Livelihood Resilience Index (LRI) based on the three-resilience capacities (3Ds) frame, using absorptive, adaptive and transformative, were used to measure households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks on agro-ecological unit of analysis. Findings indicate that the CRI and the resilience capacities based on the indexed scores of major components clearly differentiated the study communities in terms of their agro-ecological zones. Specifically, the LRI score showed that absorptive capacity (0.495) was the leading contributing factor to resilience followed by adaptive (0.449) and transformative (0.387) capacities. Likewise, the midland was relatively more resilient with a mean index value of 0.461. The study showed that access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands and livestock holdings, diversity of income sources, infrastructure and social capital were determinants of households’ resilience. In general, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with limited adaptive capacities including underdeveloped public services, poor livelihood diversification practices, among others, the study communities showed minimal resilience capacity with a mean score of 0.44. Thus, in addition to short-term buffering strategies, intervention priority focusing on both adaptive and transformative capacities, particularly focusing on most vulnerable localities and constrained livelihood strategies, would contribute to ensure long-term resilience in the study communities." />

The data were collected through cross-sectional survey conducted on 288 households, six focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews. The Climate Resilience Index (CRI) and the Livelihood Resilience Index (LRI) based on the three-resilience capacities (3Ds) frame, using absorptive, adaptive and transformative, were used to measure households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks on agro-ecological unit of analysis. Findings indicate that the CRI and the resilience capacities based on the indexed scores of major components clearly differentiated the study communities in terms of their agro-ecological zones. Specifically, the LRI score showed that absorptive capacity (0.495) was the leading contributing factor to resilience followed by adaptive (0.449) and transformative (0.387) capacities. Likewise, the midland was relatively more resilient with a mean index value of 0.461. The study showed that access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands and livestock holdings, diversity of income sources, infrastructure and social capital were determinants of households’ resilience. In general, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with limited adaptive capacities including underdeveloped public services, poor livelihood diversification practices, among others, the study communities showed minimal resilience capacity with a mean score of 0.44. Thus, in addition to short-term buffering strategies, intervention priority focusing on both adaptive and transformative capacities, particularly focusing on most vulnerable localities and constrained livelihood strategies, would contribute to ensure long-term resilience in the study communities.</p></div><span class="highwire-journal-article-marker-end"></span></div><span id="related-urls"></span></div></div>  </div>
