 <result pre="the disease dynamics. In the Americas, the southern fringe of" exact="malaria" post="distribution cuts through the north of Argentina, mainly in"/>
 <result pre="north of Argentina, mainly in Salta province. About 99% of" exact="malaria" post="cases there are caused by Plasmodium vivax parasite, although"/>
