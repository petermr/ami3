<p>Essential oils were characterized as good bioactive agents, because of oils and extracts from plants presenting LC

 <sup>−1</sup> and previous studies by Andrade et al. [

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and Nascimento et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] considered them as bioactive. Specifically, oils and plant extracts have degrees of toxicity against larvae of

 <sup>−1</sup> and were considered as having a strong cytotoxic activity. LC

 <sup>−1</sup> were considered to be moderately toxic. LC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 500 and 1000

 <sup>−1</sup> were considered as weak cytotoxic activity, while LC
