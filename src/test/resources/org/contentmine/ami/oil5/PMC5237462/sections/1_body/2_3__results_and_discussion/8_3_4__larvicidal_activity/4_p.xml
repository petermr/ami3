<p>According to the bioassay, the species
 <italic> M. piperita</italic> has a low potential larvicide at LC
 <sub>50</sub> 367.6 ppm, 
 <italic>p</italic> (value) &lt; 0.01, and coefficient of determination (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) of 0.9980; these results are statistically significant. The study is similar to research by Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Reduction of LC
 <sub>50</sub> in periods of 24 or 48 hours (111.9 and 98.66 ppm) in the potential larvicide of the species was observed. The bioactivity is ineffective for the larvae, because they develop from pupas into adults in the 60–72 h period.
