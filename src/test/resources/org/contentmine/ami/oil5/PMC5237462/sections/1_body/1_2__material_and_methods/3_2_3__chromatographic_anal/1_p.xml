<p>The essential oil analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). We used Shimadzu equipment, GCMS Shimadzu QP 5000, and employed a capillary column of fused silica OPTIMA® 5–0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, 30 m in length, and 0.25 mm internal diameter and nitrogen as a carrier gas. The gas chromatograph operating conditions were as follows: internal column pressure of 67.5 kPa, split ratio 1 : 20, the gas flow in column 1.2 mL/min. (210°C), injector temperature 260°C, and the temperature detector or the interface (GC-MS) of 280°C. The initial column temperature was 50°C followed by an increase of 6°C/min. up to 260°C and maintained constant for 30 min. The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings in a range 29–400 Da, 0.5 s intervals with ionization energy of 70 eV.
