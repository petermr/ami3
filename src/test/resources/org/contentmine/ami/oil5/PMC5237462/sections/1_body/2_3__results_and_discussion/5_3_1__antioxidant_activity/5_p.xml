 <italic> M. piperita</italic> is described by several authors as a potential antioxidant, and there are also reports of cytotoxic activity. Some authors describe the possible elimination of monoterpene ketones (menthone and isomenthone) and 1,8-cineole in changing the chemical composition of the species [
