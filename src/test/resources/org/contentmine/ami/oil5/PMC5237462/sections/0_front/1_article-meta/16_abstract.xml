 <p>The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and the identification and quantification of components were achieved with the use of GC-MS analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the method of sequestration of DPPH. Essential oils were used for study the cytotoxic front larvae of
  <italic> Artemia salina</italic>. In the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, we employed the disk-diffusion method. The potential larvicide in mosquito larvae of the third stage of development of
  <italic> Aedes aegypti</italic> to different concentrations of essential oils was evaluated. The major compounds found in the essential oils of
  <italic> M. piperita</italic> were linalool (51.8%) and epoxyocimene (19.3%). The percentage of antioxidant activity was 79.9 ± 1.6%. The essential oil showed LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 414.6 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL front of
  <italic> A. saline</italic> and is considered highly toxic. It shows sensitivity and halos significant inhibition against
  <italic> E. coli</italic>. The essential possessed partial larvicidal efficiency against
  <italic> A. aegypti</italic>.
