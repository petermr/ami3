<p>Moreover, these differences in the chemical composition may explain the differences in the antimicrobial activities. In fact, our

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 0.25 and 31.25 for 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> respectively, which means that our studied species had more powerful antibacterial activity against studied microbial species than the Turkish
