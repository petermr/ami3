<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> extracted by microwave-ultrasonic method used in this study exhibited potential bioactivity against the growth of all microbes examined in this study. With all of the studied pathogens, the highest antimicrobial activity (lowest MIC) against microbes examined was seen against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> with MIC value of 0.25 mg/ml, while the MIC for 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and MRSA was 0.5 mg/ml as shown in Table
