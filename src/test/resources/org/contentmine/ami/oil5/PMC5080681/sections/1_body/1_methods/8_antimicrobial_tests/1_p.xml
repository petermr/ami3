<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> was investigated for its antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antibacterial activity was examined against the growth of four reference bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853) as well as against the growth of a diagnostically-confirmed Methicillin Resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) clinical isolates. The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil was examined against the growth of a diagnostically-confirmed 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> clinical isolate. The antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> oil used in this study were determined by using broth micro-dilution method as described previously by Wikler 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> was dissolved in 5 % Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 132 mg/ml. The prepared oil solution was filter-sterilized and then was serially micro-diluted (2 folds) 11 times in sterile nutrient broth. The dilution processes were carried out under aseptic conditions in 96 well plates. In the micro-wells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the oil, the concentration of this oil ranged from 0.129 to 66 mg/ml. While the concentrations of this oil in the micro-wells assigned to evaluate their antifungal activities ranged from 0.065 to 55 mg/ml. In these plates, micro-well number 11 contained essential oils-free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth. On the other hand, micro-well number 12 contained essential oils-free nutrient broth that was left un-inoculated with any of the test microbes. This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth. Micro-wells numbers 1 to 11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes. At the time of inoculation, the final concentrations of microbial cells were about 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> and 0.5–2.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml for the tested bacterial pathogens and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, respectively. Each of the included microbes in this study was examined in duplicate for being inhibited by the obtained 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil.
