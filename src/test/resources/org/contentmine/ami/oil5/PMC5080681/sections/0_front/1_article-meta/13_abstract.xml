  <title>Background</title>
  <p>It has been recently recognized that oxidative stress, helminth and microbial infections are the cause of much illness found in the underdeveloped, developing and developed countries. The present study was undertaken to identify the chemical composition, and to assess anthelmintic, antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of 
   <italic>Thymus bovei</italic> essential oil.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity was tested against the selected strains from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and clinical isolates such as 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
   <italic>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> Methicillin Resistant 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
   <italic>Candida albicans</italic> using MIC assay. The anthelmintic assay was carried out on adult earthworm (
   <italic>Pheretima posthuma</italic>), while antioxidant activity was analyzed using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Trans-geraniol (35.38 %), α-citral (20.37 %) and β-citral (14.76 %) were the major compounds comprising 70.51 % of the essential oil. Our results showed that 
   <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil exhibited strong anthelmintic activity, even higher than piperazine citrate, the used reference standard, with potential antioxidant activity almost equal to the Trolox standard. Furthermore, 
   <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil had powerful antibacterial and antifungal activities against the studied pathogens.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Essential oil of 
   <italic>T. bovei</italic> exerted excellent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anthelmintic activities. Moreover, this study found that 
   <italic>T. bovei</italic> volatile oil contains active substances that could potentially be used as natural preservatives in food and pharmaceutical industries, these substances could also be employed for developing new anthelmintic, antimicrobial and antioxidant agents.
