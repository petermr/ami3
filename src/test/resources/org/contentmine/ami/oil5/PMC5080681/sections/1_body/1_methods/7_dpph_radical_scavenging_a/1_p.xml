<p>A stock solution of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil was used to prepare stock solutions in methanol and Trolox, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Each of these stock solutions was diluted in methanol to prepare 12 working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100 μg/ml. A fresh solution of prepared DPPH (0.002%w/v) was mixed with methanol and with each of the above mentioned working solutions at 1:1:1 ratio. In addition, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the above mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in 1:1 ratio. Then, all of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min. The optical density of these solutions was determined by using spectrophotometer at a wave length of 517 nm using methanol as the blank solution. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil and Trolox were determined using the following formula:
