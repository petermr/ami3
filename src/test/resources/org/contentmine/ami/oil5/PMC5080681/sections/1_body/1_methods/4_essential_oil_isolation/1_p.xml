<p>The microwave-ultrasonic method is a recently developed method used for the extraction of essential oils from medicinal plants. In this method, the volatile oil was extracted using a microwave oven with ultra-sonication. However, during the extraction process, the powder suspension being extracted was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the extraction process. In this study, the apparatus consisting of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor was used (Ultrasonic-microwave Cooperative Extractor/Reactor (CW-2000, China)). A one L round bottom flask containing about 100 g of the plant was placed in this apparatus. In this flask, the plant was suspended in about 500 ml deionized water. Then, the flask was connected with Clevenger apparatus, which was placed in the same apparatus. While carrying out the extraction process, the power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000 W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50 W and at a frequency of 40 kHz). The extraction process using this apparatus was conducted for 10 min at 100 °C. This process was repeated three times. The obtained volatile oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried and stored in well closed dark amber colored bottles in the refrigerator at −4 °C. The yield of this extraction method was 1.4 % w/w based on the fresh weight.</p>
