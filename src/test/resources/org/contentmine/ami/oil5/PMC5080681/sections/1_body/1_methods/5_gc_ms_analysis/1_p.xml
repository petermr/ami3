<p>GC-MS chromatograms were recorded using Shimadzu QP-5000 GC-MS. The GC was equipped with Rtx-5 ms column (30 m long, 0.25 μm thickness and 0.250 mm inner diameter). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Injector temperature was 220 °C. Oven temperature was programmed from 50 °C (1 min hold) at 5 °C/min to 130 °C, then at 10 °C/min to 250 °C and kept isothermally for 15 min. Transfer line temperature was 290 °C. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with detector volts of 1.7 KV was used. A scan rate of 0.5 s, and scan speed 1000 amu/s was applied, covering a mass range from 38–450 M/Z.</p>
