<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the chemical composition and biological activity of 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil originating from this area. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of the essential oil of wild-growing 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> from the city of Jericho in Palestine. The goal was also to test the anthelmintic, antioxidant, antifungal and antibacterial activities of the analyzed essential oil as a potentially new source of biologically active natural products, especially that this plant has been used in the Palestinian folk medicine from ancient times as anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory and as antiseptic.
