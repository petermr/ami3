<p>The cytotoxicity assay against 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>salina</italic> Leach was based on the technique of Araujo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Lobo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with adaptations. an aqueous solution of synthetic sea salt was prepared (35.5 gL
 <sup>-1</sup>) for the incubation of 25 mg of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>salina</italic> eggs, which were placed in the dark for 24 h to larvae hatching (nauplius), then the nauplius were exposed to artificial light in 24 hour period to reach metanauplius stage. The mother solution was prepared to contain 54 mg of essential oil added 22.5 mL of synthetic sea salt solution and 4.5 mL of 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to facilitate solubilization of it.
