<p>For BeatoviÄ‡ et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the OE antioxidant capacity is related to their major compounds, but this study has not observed the antioxidant activity. Studies with 
 <italic>Ocimun basilicum</italic> species, and linalool as major compound showed strong antioxidant capacity [
