<p>The identification of essential oil components was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using Shimadzu equipment, MEGCs QP-2010 Plus model. Column DB-5 HT, Mark J &amp; W Scientific, 30 m long, 0.32 mm diameter, 0.10 micron Indicated film thickness, and nitrogen as carrier gas. The gas chromatograph operating conditions were: an Internal pressure of 56.7 kPa column, split ratio 1:20, the column gas flow of 1.0 mL / min. (210°C), injector temperature 220°C, the temperature detector or the interface (GC-MS) 240°C. The initial column temperature was 60°C, followed by an increase of 3°C/min. up to 240°C and maintained constant for 30 min. The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings in a range of 29–400 Da 0.5s, intervals with ionization energy of 70 eV. It was injected 1μL of each sample at a concentration of 10,000 ppm dissolved in hexane. The identification of the components was based on the comparison of their Kovats index (KI) and mass spectra of each substance with the literature data.</p>
