<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>suaveolens</italic> was determined using GC-MS identification of major constituents present in this oil (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166684.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The chemical constituents detected in the oil extracted from the leaves, 1.57% are monoterpenes hydrocarbons, 39.65% are oxygenated monoterpenes, 43.56% are sesquiterpenes hydrocarbon, and 2.87% are lactones. As the major components (E) -β-farnesene (37.615%), linalool (33.375%), α-santalene (3.255%) and linalyl acetate (3.222%) (
