<p>The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) or Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) were evaluated for each set of wells. For the MIC evaluation, a loopful of broth was collected from those wells where any growth was observed and then was further inoculated on sterile Mueller-Hinton medium broth for bacteria and Sabouraud medium for yeasts by streaking. The plates were then inoculated with microorganism and were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, the lowest concentration was considered as MBC (for bacteria) and MFC (for yeasts) and presented in 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, at which no visible growth was observed.
