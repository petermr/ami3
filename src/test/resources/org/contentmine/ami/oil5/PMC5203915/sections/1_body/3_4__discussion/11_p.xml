<p>Many studies have also indicated that natural plant secondary metabolites may be used for the prevention of inflammation and oxidative damage-related neurodegenerative diseases [

 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants, astrocytes were treated with HR and SGR essential oils and stimulated by LPS for 24 h. It was found that HR and SGR essential oils possessed anti-neuroinflammatory activity and were able to suppress the levels of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. In response to inflammation molecular signaling cascades are activated in astrocytes. IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> are secreted during acute inflammation and are important for the production of IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the stimulation of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> causes astrocytes to generate and release vascular endothelial growth factor, which increases blood-brain barrier permeability and promotes leukocyte extravasation [

 <italic>α</italic> level and shows neuroprotective effect by changes of intracellular calcium and mediates delay effects
 <italic> via</italic> NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, in response to IL-10, astrocytes release transforming growth factor-
 <italic>β</italic> (TGF
 <italic>β</italic>) that suppresses the inflammation [
