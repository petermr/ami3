<p>The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were evaluated using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA). The procedure was performed according to the previous study [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The astrocytes were seeded in 96-well plate, incubated only with LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) or stimulated with LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and treated with HR and SGR essential oils (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 hours. Then, the cells were lysed, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and incubated with 5

 <sub>2</sub>DCF-DA at 37°C for 30 min. ROS fluorescence (DCF) was measured in microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm. The experiments were repeated three times.
