<p>The study also evaluates the anti-inflammatory activity of
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> HR and SGR essential oils in LPS-induced astrocytes. Astrocytes are multifunctional glial cells in the central nervous system and can regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, control the release of antioxidant defences, and are associated with the immune response by the production of inflammatory mediators such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prostaglandin E, and nitric oxide [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The inflammation causes neuronal death and brain injury. The activation of astrocytes leads to the release of neutrophic factors which regulate the survival and function of nervous tissue [

 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> HR and SGR essential oils did not inhibit the viability of astrocytes at concentrations between 0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 800 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.
