 <p>The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation from the hairy roots (HR) and roots of soil-grown plants (SGR) of
  <italic> Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> and were analyzed by GC-MS method. In the both essential oils 62 compounds were identified. The root essential oils showed the differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition. The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (55–62%) dominated in both essential oils. The major compounds of HR essential oil were cyperene, 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene, and cadalene while aplotaxene, nardosina-1(10),11-diene, and dauca-4(11),8-diene dominated in SGR essential oil. Both essential oils showed antibacterial activity especially against
  <italic> Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (ATCC 29212) and
  <italic> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853) (MIC value = 125 
  <italic>µ</italic>g/mL). HR and SGR essential oils also decreased the expression of IL-1
  <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
  <italic>α</italic> and the ROS level in LPS-treatment astrocytes. This is the first report to describe the chemical composition of
  <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> essential oil from hairy roots, its protective effect against LPS-induced inflammation and ROS production in astrocytes, and its antimicrobial potential. The results show that
  <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> hairy roots may be a valuable source of the essential oil and may be an alternative to the roots of soil-grown plants.
