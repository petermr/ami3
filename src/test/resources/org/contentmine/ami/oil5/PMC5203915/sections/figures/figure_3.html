 <caption> The effect of Rhaponticum carthamoides HR and SGR essential oils on the expression of the inflammatory-related gene (IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF- α) in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. mRNA expression levels were measured by RT-PCR analysis. Astrocytes were incubated for 24 h with 100  μg/mL of HR or SGR essential oils and LPS (1  μg/mL). (a) The bar graph shows the relative density. The data is represented as means ± SD of three independent experiments. ∗ p &lt; 0.05 versus LPS-treated cells. (b) Lanes: 1: control; 2: cell incubated with SGR essential oil; 3: cell incubated with HR essential oil; 4: cell incubated with LPS; 5: cell incubated with SGR essential oil + LPS; 6: cell incubated with HR essential oil + LPS. </caption>
