<p>Although the chemical profile of both
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> root essential oils differed, these oils showed similar anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory effects of major compounds of HR and SGR essential oils have not yet been reported. Only, aplotaxene which was the dominant compound in SGR essential oil demonstrated an immunosuppressive effect by the inhibition of T cell activation
 <italic> via</italic> the reduction of IL-2 and CD69 expression. However, aplotaxene inhibited MAPK activation and the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), NF-
