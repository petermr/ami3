<p>Nevertheless, although qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> SGR and HR essential oils, the biological activities, that is, the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, of these essential oils were similar. We suspect that this may be due to similar activities of the major components of the SGR and HR essential oils. While it is known that the biological activity of essential oils may be related with the major compounds, their action might be changed by different interaction with the minor components [
