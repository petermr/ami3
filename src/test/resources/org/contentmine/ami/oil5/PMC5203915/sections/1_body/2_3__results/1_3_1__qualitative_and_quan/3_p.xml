<p>Sesquiterpenes, especially sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.7–62.2%), dominated in both essential oils (

 <italic>all</italic>-
 <italic>cis</italic>-heptadeca-1,8,11,14-tetraene) was the main constituent (27.3%). Among the sesquiterpenes, nardosina-1(10),11-diene was identified as the most dominant compound (20.7%) in this essential oil according to its mass spectrum and retention index [

 <italic>α</italic>-bergamotene (4.2%) were presented in appreciable amounts in SGR essential oil (
