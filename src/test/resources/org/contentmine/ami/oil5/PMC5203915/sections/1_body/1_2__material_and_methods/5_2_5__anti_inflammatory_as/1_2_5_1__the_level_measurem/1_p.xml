<p>The Multi-Analyte ELISArray Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) were used to estimate the level of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and GM-CSF in the supernatant of astrocytes incubated for 24 h with HR and SGR essential oils (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), only LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), or only 25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils, according to protocol of the manufacturer. The cells incubated in the culture medium for 24 h were used as a control. The results were expressed as mean absorbance/OD (450 nm) value and were performed in triplicate.
