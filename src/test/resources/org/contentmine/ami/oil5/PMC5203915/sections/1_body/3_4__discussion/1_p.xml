<p>The aim of this study was to identify and quantitatively determine the constituents in the essential oils of
 <italic> Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> hairy roots (HR) and roots of soil-grown plants (SGR), to examine the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of these essential oils in LPS-stimulated astrocytes, and to determine the antimicrobial potential of HR and SGR essential oils. This is the first report that describes the composition of HR essential oil and its biological potential. Some essential oil possesses many biological properties with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities [
