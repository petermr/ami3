<p>In this study we also evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of HR and SGR essential oils in LPS-treated astrocytes. The levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in astrocytes incubated for 24 h with HR and SGR essential oils (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), only LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), or only 25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils were measured using the ELISA Kits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). LPS treatment of astrocytes led to increased levels of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in comparison to the control cells. Treatment of LPS-stimulated astrocytes with HR and SGR essential oils dose-dependently reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> but not IL-10, IL-8, or GM-CSF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, the expression levels of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in LPS-stimulated astrocytes were analyzed by RT-PCR after 24 h incubation with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A single concentration of essential oils known to be the most effective for reducing of the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as determined by an ELISA, was used in this experiment. RT-PCR analyses showed also that treatment with HR and SGR essential oils resulted in the downregulation of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> mRNA expression in LPS-induced astrocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). No change was observed in the mRNA expression of IL-10, IL-8, and GM-CSF in comparison with astrocytes treated with only LPS.
