<p>The isolation yield was 1.25% (v/w), based on dry plant material and confirmed that the plant analyzed meets the requirements of pharmaceutical quality for thyme as EO source [

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>
 </bold>. Fifteen components representing 99.91% of the total detected constituents were identified. The major components were p-cymene (8.41%), γ-terpinene (30.90%) and thymol (47.59%), which suggests that the EO analyzed belongs to the thymol chemotype in agreement with those previously reported in Romania [
