 <caption> In situ TEM analysis. ( a) Gr–Si NPs attached to the surface of Au wire and a second Li/LiO 2 electrode. ( b) The same Gr–Si NPs after lithiation. ( c) A schematic summary of lithiated Gr–Si NPs for both non-defective and defective graphene encapsulation. ( d, e) Close up TEM images for ( d) non-defective particle (the one circled with the red line in a and b) and ( e) defective particle (the one circled with the blue line in a and b). The EELS spectra in both cases confirm the lithiation. The line profiles from the red boxes in both cases show increased interlayer distances of ca. 3.8 Å, reflective of lithiation into the graphene interlayer space. </caption>
