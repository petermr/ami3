<p>To see the improvement in the volumetric energy density in a more tangible manner, both the 5 wt%-Gr–Si (108 μm thick) and graphite electrodes (168 μm thick) were packed into commercial 18650 cylindrical cells with all other conditions (cathode and separator) fixed. When wound into a roll using a commercial taper tension controller, the roll diameter of the 5 wt%-Gr–Si full cell was 14.2 mm, which is significantly shorter than that (17.4 mm) of the commercial graphite counterpart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>), providing direct evidence of the increased volumetric energy density by the direct graphene growth. The present full cell exhibited 972 Wh l
 <sup>−1</sup> at its initial cycle, and this value decreased to 700 Wh l
 <sup>−1</sup> after 200 cycles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). It is also worth noting that the capacity after 200 cycles is still 1.5 times higher than that (471 Wh l
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the graphite-based control cell. These volumetric energy densities of the graphene-based full cells are converted to 242.0 and 169.6 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> at the first and 200th cycles, which are ∼22% and 0% times higher than those of the graphite-based control full cell, respectively. In addition, despite the high volumetric energy density due to the dense graphene-coated Si particle packing, safety is unlikely to be an issue because the volume change of the anode is &lt;10% of the entire cell volume.
