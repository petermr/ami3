<p>The direct growth of high-quality graphene on Si via CVD process has proven challenging
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> because typical graphene synthesis conditions require a reducing atmosphere that tends to strip the native Si oxide layer off the Si surface, and then drives a reaction between Si and decomposed carbon precursors to form SiC
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Our initial approach of using methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>) as a carbon precursor mixed with H
 <sub>2</sub> was indeed unable to achieve a graphene growth on the Si NPs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), thereby yielding only β-SiC (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we included carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), a mild oxidant, in the CVD process along with CH
 <sub>4</sub> (refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The inclusion of CO
 <sub>2</sub> allows one to avoid the formation of SiC and also lower the growth temperature compared with well-known graphene growth on surface
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In our experiment, at 900 °C, the graphene growth was incomplete or inhomogeneous (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), whereas graphene growth at 1,100 °C produced oxide layers on the Si surface that are too thick for efficient Li ion diffusion (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). At an intermediate temperature of 1,000 °C, 2–10 layers of graphene were formed as shown in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) clearly displaying the layered structure as well as the interlayer distance near 3.4 Å (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, inset). Closer inspection indicates that individual layers are anchored directly to the Si particle surface at their ends (red arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and lie parallel to the Si surface. These well-aligned graphene layers can maintain their layered stacking structure even during lithiation via a sliding process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), thus providing an elegant means to accommodate the volume expansion of Si. Graphene growth has been attempted on Si dioxide (SiO
 <sub>2</sub>) surfaces using CH
 <sub>4</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub> (refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, the graphene growth in those processes was very inefficient or does not avoid SiC formation. The inefficient growth is ascribed to insufficient catalytic sites on SiO
 <sub>2</sub> surface. By contrast, in our process, the CO
 <sub>2</sub> addition generates more catalytic sites in the form of SiO
