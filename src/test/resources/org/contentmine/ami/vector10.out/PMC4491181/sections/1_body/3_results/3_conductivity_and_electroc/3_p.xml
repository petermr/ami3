<p>The graphene coating makes a drastic difference in the cycling performance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). For a fair comparison among the samples, we first set the areal capacity to 1 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Under this constraint, the capacity fading of both 2 wt%-AC–Si and pristine Si was significant even for early cycles, indicating that a simple AC coating is not operational at all. Between both Gr–Si samples, 5 wt%-Gr–Si exhibited better performance than that of 1 wt%-Gr–Si (85% versus 70% retention after 200 cycles), suggesting that depending on the areal capacity, the graphene content becomes critical. The lower retention of 1 wt%-Gr–Si might be explained by occasional defect formation as observed in our 
 <italic>in situ</italic> TEM investigation based on the same graphene content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). For the 5 wt% graphene sample, the testing was expanded to even higher areal capacities up to 6 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). For areal capacities of 1, 3 and 6 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, the capacity retentions after 100 cycles were 96%, 91% and 43%, respectively. These samples also delivered good CEs of 99.6, 99.3, and 99.4% after 100 cycles, respectively. The effect of the conformal graphene coating on the structural integrity of Si NPs was elucidated by post-mortem scanning electron microscope (SEM) and TEM images after 200 cycles. Even after 200 cycles, the SEM image of 5 wt%-Gr–Si visualized individual NPs with clear particle boundaries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). By contrast, the SEM image of 2 wt%-AC–Si showed that solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers overgrew and buried individual NPs, indicating the importance of the graphene coating on the stability of SEI layers. The TEM analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 9–11</xref>) of 5 wt%-Gr–Si visualized the preserved individual layers of the graphene coating, confirming their robust integration with Si NPs during the repeated large volume change again through the sliding process. In addition, the film thickness of 5 wt%-Gr–Si with 3 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> increased by 51.3% (15.0→22.7 μm) after the first cycle, which is substantially smaller than that (77.4%, 10.2→18.1 μm) of 5 wt%-Super P-pristine Si even with half the areal specific capacity of 1.5 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>.
