<p>XRD patterns were obtained by using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker Inc., 40 kV, 40 mA) engaging nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic>=1.54 Å). The scan rate and interval were 4° min
 <sup>−1</sup> and 0.02°, respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed by using Physical Electronics (Quantera II, ULVAC-PHI, Inc.) with an Al Kα source (1,486.7 eV). The carbon content on Si NPs was quantitatively analysed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>) by using a thermogravimetry analyser (METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC1). High-resolution TEM, diffraction pattern and EELS analyses were carried out using FEI Titan Cubed 60–300 equipped with double Cs correctors and Gatan Quantum 965. The samples were also visualized using field-emission SEM (Nova NanoSEM 450S, FEI) to monitor the morphology change. The electronic conductivity of the pellet was measured using the four-probe DC method after pelletizing active powder at 20 kN (MCP-PD511, Mitsubishi).
