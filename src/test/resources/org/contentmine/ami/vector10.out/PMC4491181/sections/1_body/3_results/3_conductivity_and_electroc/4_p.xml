<p>According to TEM images after the first delithiation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) and the 200th delithiation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), the interlayer distance of the graphene layers remained at ∼3.8 Å, indicating that the sliding process is not fully reversible. These phenomena are attributed to a combined effect from SEI layer formation and residual Li ions between the graphene layers, together with the smaller volume shrinkage during the first delithiation than the volume expansion of the first lithiation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Nonetheless, the graphene layers remain rooted on the Si surfaces, continuously fulfilling their original roles as a conducting agent and a buffering medium to accommodate volume expansion of Si.
