<p>We now turn to the use of Gr–Si as an anode material in LIBs. The lithiation of the Gr–Si NPs (1 wt% graphene) was monitored in real time during their volume expansion using 
 <italic>in situ</italic> TEM analysis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In the actual experiment, some Gr–Si particles were placed onto a gold (Au)-fixed electrode. A second, but movable, electrode with Li/LiO
 <sub>2</sub> at its tip was positioned to just come into contact with the Gr–Si NPs to lithiate them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Once contact with the second electrode was made, the particles began to swell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Greater details on this process can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1–3</xref>. Two types of expanding structures were observed, namely non-defective particles and defective particles as highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>. In cases where the graphene fully encapsulates the particle and has no obvious defects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), the diameter increased by ∼30% (220% volume expansion). At the end of lithiation, the interlayer distance of the graphene layers increased to 3.8 Å reflective of Li intercalation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and the layered characteristic of the graphitic coating was preserved all round the NP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting a sliding process between layers as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>. In cases where a defective region exists (see green circle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), upon swelling, the inner particle pulverizes and ruptures through the defect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The observed distinct fracture behaviours are unlikely to be from particle size, as an encapsulated particle bigger than the fractured one in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> did not fracture (see the indicated particles at 0 and 40 s in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Also, recent observation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> indicates that if not encapsulated, even smaller Si particles (&lt;50 nm) can fracture due to Li concentration gradient within the particles that can create a substantial stress. In fact, the critical size of Si particle fracture is case dependent, and is related on how efficiently the stress built up during volume expansion is able to be released. The critical size can extend to &gt;200 nm (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).
