<p>Since the diffusion of Li ions in and out of the electrode structure is frequently the rate determining step, this must be improved to allow a fast charge and discharge of the battery.
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> With this goal in mind, scientists have put substantial efforts on developing new nanostructured materials, which facilitate the Li ion diffusion due to a reduced diffusion length within the active material particles and an increased electrode/electrolyte contact area. A variety of both anode and cathode materials was proposed in form of nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanotubes, etc.
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additionally, highly structured carbon nanocomposites were developed to enhance not only the ionic but also the electronic conductivity of the electrode.
