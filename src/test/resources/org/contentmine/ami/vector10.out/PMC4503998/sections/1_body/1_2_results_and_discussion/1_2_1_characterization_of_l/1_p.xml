<p>Due to their rather poor electronic and ionic conductivities, cathode materials are frequently limiting the high power performance of lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, in order to keep up with the excellent rate capability of ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-C anodes (ZFO), carbon-rich LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> (LFP) positive electrodes were prepared. Accordingly, commercial, carbon-coated, sub-micrometric LFP particles were embedded in an extensive network of multi-walled carbon nanotubes to form a composite cathode, which is hereinafter called LFP-CNT. As shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a, because of their tubular shape, CNTs form an extended electronically conductive network interconnecting the single LFP particles (see inset 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>a), thus guaranteeing an efficient and rapid electron transport. In fact, such a large amount of conductive additive most probably exceeds the electronic percolation threshold. Additionally, the excess of carbon nanotubes shall ensure an advanced high rate performance of the commercial LFP particles with respect to the targeted application in a high power lithium-ion full-cell. In fact, as suggested by Sotowa et al.
