<p>Differently, the discharge voltage of the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cell is remarkably retained upon increasing the current density because of the large amount of lithium stored in ZFO-600, resulting in a lower average anode voltage. Even for the maximum applied current density of 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, it is 0.43 V higher than that of the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell. Such phenomenon would suggest faster kinetics of the alloying mechanism compared to the conversion mechanism. As clearly shown by the Ragone-like plot, displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4b</xref>, the substantially higher cell voltage results in a remarkable improvement in terms of full-cell specific energy. In fact, while all cells display very high specific power, even exceeding 3 kW kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (i.e., 3.02 kW kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and 3.72 kW kg
 <sup>−1</sup> at 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> for ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively), only the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT has a considerably higher specific energy. Specifically, the doping with 600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> leads to a gain in specific energy of about 37–40% compared to the other two cells, independently from the applied current. The innovative combination ZFO/LFP-CNT we propose in this work demonstrates therefore incredibly promising features. This cell chemistry displays maximum power values similar to those of lithium-ion capacitors (LIC), while offering considerably higher specific energies. To the best of our knowledge, the highest specific energies reported for LIC have been achieved by graphite/AC systems and, referred to the weights of the active materials, barely exceed 100 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>.
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> So far, the highest value (125 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) was obtained by Kim et al., using an artificial graphite anode,
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which is considerably lower than the values provided by the ZFO/LFP-CNT cells. In fact, although we are aware that comparing specific energies obtained at different power/current is not fully appropriate, we do believe that the value of 202 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (at 0.1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) shown by the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT represents a remarkable achievement, testifying the great potential of such novel battery chemistry. The ZFO/LFP-CNT cells (as well as most lithium-ion capacitors) contain a not negligible amount of carbon and binder. However, the specific capacity values are still remarkable (see detailed values displayed in 
 <bold>Table</bold>
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Indeed, considering the total mass of the electrodes (including active materials, carbon and binder), the ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cells deliver 132 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. Such a value accounts for an improvement of almost 30% with respect to the 103.8 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> reported by Khomenko et al.
