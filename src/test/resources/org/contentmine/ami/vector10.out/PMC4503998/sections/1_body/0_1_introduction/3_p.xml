<p>While the scientific literature abounds in studies focusing on the performance of newly developed active materials in half-cell configuration, there are only very few reports on full batteries with power-oriented performance. Basically, the most common battery configurations are Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>/LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>.
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The latter system, when activated carbon is added to the positive electrode, was at the same time also investigated regarding its utilization as a lithium-ion capacitor.
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, the vast majority of these anyway only few studies utilized Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> as active material on the anode side. As an alternative, Derrien et al.
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and Brutti et al.
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> recently reported very interesting results by combining a Sn-C-based anode with LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and carbon-coated LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> as cathode, respectively. Substituted metal oxides, such as the spinel ZnCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (e.g., 3D nanowire arrays on carbon cloth), were also demonstrated to be superior to graphite in terms of rate performance in flexible lithium-ion cells with LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes.
 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Similar to ZnCo

 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> offering the great advantage of being more environmentally friendly, more cost-efficient, and less toxic due to the replacement of cobalt by iron. Bresser et al.
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> demonstrated very recently that, beside the reversible capacity values exceeding 1000 mA g

 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles exhibit also excellent rate capability. Nevertheless, within their study they focused on the characterization of this new active material using half-cells only.
