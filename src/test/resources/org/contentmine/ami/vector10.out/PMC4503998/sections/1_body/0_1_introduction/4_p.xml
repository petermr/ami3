<p>Here, we propose for the first time a novel battery configuration wherein carbon-coated ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles are employed as negative electrode material and a multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT)-LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> composite is used on the positive electrode side (also referred to here as ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-C/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>-CNT). As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the great potential of such combination. In addition to the fact that only electrodes were employed, which were prepared using environmentally friendly, water-based Na-carboxymethyl cellulose as binder, more remarkably, this new lithium-ion full-cell provides advanced high rate performance and excellent cycling stability.
