<p>The capacity delivered by the full-cells under increasing current density is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3b</xref>. All devices display an initial capacity increase upon the first 20 cycles. Such behavior closely resembles the results observed in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>b and, therefore, can be attributed to the initial activation of the LFP-CNT cathode. The capacity values obtained at the 20
 <sup>th</sup> cycle approach the practical capacity of the positive electrode, accounting for specific capacities ranging from 93 to 101 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> depending on the active material mass loading of both electrodes. The different lithiation degree of the ZFO anodes does not appear to considerably affect the rate capability of the full-cells. All cells deliver more than 50% of the initial capacity for the highest applied current density of 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. It is worth to notice that such a current density corresponds to 4.89C and 19.23C for ZFO and LFP, respectively. Differently from the ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cells, which show very stable capacity values at any current density, the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell seems to suffer of a certain capacity fading when the current density exceeds 0.5 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. At such current densities, as clearly noticeable from the voltage profiles displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>c, the ZFO-deLi anode becomes limiting during the cell discharge. In fact, due to the increasing polarization, the potential of the fully de-lithiated negative electrode easily reaches the upper cut-off potential (i.e., 2.8 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>, equivalent to the LFP-CNT lower cut-off), leading to the incomplete utilization of the positive electrode and, subsequently, to a progressive capacity fading at elevated rates. This phenomenon is not observed in ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT cells for which the anodes, because of the introduction of a defined amount of Li, operates in a more negative voltage window, thus buffering the voltage increase caused by polarization. In 
 <bold>Figure</bold>
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>a, the average discharge voltage of the investigated cells is plotted as a function of the applied current density. Up to 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> the doping turns out to be a generally effective strategy for raising the full-cell discharge potential. However, in the case of the ZFO-200/LFP-CNT cell, when the load is increased, the average voltage drops to values comparable (and even lower) to those of the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell.
