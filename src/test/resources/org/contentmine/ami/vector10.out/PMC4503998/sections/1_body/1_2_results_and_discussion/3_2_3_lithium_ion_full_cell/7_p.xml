<p>As expected, the capacity fading is generally accompanied by an increase in polarization between charge and discharge. From the selected voltage profiles displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5b</xref> it is evident that the ZFO anode is the primary cause of such increase. Structural changes in the active material, as well as passivation of the electrode surface might be responsible for this behavior. In any case, such processes seem to take place mainly upon the first 5000 cycles. While this applies strictly to ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, the performance of the ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT cell appears to be additionally affected by a continuous capacity loss of the positive electrode. Considering that the cathode is in this cell the only lithium source besides the electrolyte, it is reasonable to attribute such decay to the lithium depletion in LFP. This phenomenon is avoided (or at least significantly delayed) in the other two cells within which, due to the partial lithiation of the ZFO anodes, a Li reservoir was generated, which is able to buffer the irreversible charge consumption upon cycling. Apart from this, no particular ageing phenomenon appears to have a dramatic effect on the performance of ZFO/LFP-CNT cells. This finding is strongly supported by the impedance spectra displayed in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>. Indeed, the Nyquist plots recorded after 10 000 cycles highly resemble those of the fresh cells. No additional semicircles or peculiar features are detected, although, of course, a certain increase of the overall cell impedance is observed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref> insets, this is mostly due to: i) higher electrolyte resistance (identified by the high frequency intercept with the Z
 <sub>real</sub> axis) and ii) contact/charge transfer resistance (evidenced by the diameter of the high frequency semicircle). However, such increases are, in our opinion, acceptable for cells operating for such a large number of cycles.
