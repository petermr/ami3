<p>After recording the impedance spectra, the same full cells that underwent 10 000 cycles at 3 mA cm

 <sub>TOT</sub>. In regard to the values obtained at the same current before the stability tests (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>b), these numbers results in remarkable capacity retentions of 73%, 72%, and 76% for ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT, ZFO-200/LFP-CNT, and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively.
