<p>A further key feature of the ZFO/LFP-CNT cells is their impressive cycling stability. In fact, as shown in 
 <bold>Figure</bold>
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>a, such cells are able to sustain 10 000 galvanostatic cycles at a current density of 3 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (i.e., 9.61C for LFP and 2.45C for ZFO) with rather limited capacity fading. After a few stabilization cycles, the cells deliver rather similar capacities comprised between 42 and 48 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <sub>TOT</sub> (corresponding to 75–86 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <sub>LFP</sub>) for the 10
 <sup>th</sup> discharge. In the following cycles, however, while for ZFO-deLi/LFP-CNT a rather rapid decrease in capacity after 1000 cycles is observed, the cells assembled with doped anodes display considerably stable capacity retentions. After 10,000 cycles, ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT still deliver specific capacities of respectively 33 and 41 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <sub>TOT</sub> (i.e., 60 and 74 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <sub>LFP</sub>). In regard to the initial capacities (considered at the 10
 <sup>th</sup> cycle) such values account for a capacity retention of 79% and 85% for ZFO-200/LFP-CNT and ZFO-600/LFP-CNT, respectively.
