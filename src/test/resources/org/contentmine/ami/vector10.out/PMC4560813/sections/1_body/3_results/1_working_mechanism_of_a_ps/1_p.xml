 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> schematically shows the fabricated system for photo-charging a LIB by PSCs connected in series. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, the photogenerated free holes and electrons within the PSCs flow into the cathode and anode of the LIB, respectively. This current flow from the PSC to the close circuited LIB (top, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) leads to charging the LIB through oxidative extraction of lithium ions from the cathode (for example, olive structure LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>), followed by reductive insertion onto the anode (for example, spinel structure Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>). The energy (charge) stored during the charging process can be released to external loading (bottom, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) by turning S1 off and S2 on, which is accompanied by a simultaneous back flow of lithium ions from the anode to cathode.
