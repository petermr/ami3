<p>The cathode (anode) was fabricated by blending LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>, LFPO (Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>, LTO) with acetylene black carbon and polyvinylidene difluoride at a weight ratio of 90:5:5, respectively. 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was used as the solvent. The slurries were stirred in a sealed glass bottle for 3 h. The resultant LiFePO

 <sub>12</sub> slurries were then coated on Al and Cu foils, respectively. The LIBs were assembled as the CR 2032 coin-type cells in an Ar-filled glove box. The LFPO–Li and LTO–Li half-cells were assembled from LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> or Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> with a mass loading of 11–13 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> as the working electrode, using Li foils as the counter electrode and reference electrode, porous polypropylene film as separator and 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in a 1:1:1 (v/v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte. The LFPO–LTO full cell was assembled by using LFPO and LTO as the cathode and anode, respectively. The LFPO–Li, LTO–Li and LFPO–LTO cells were measured using an automatic battery tester system (Land, China) as PS and photo-charged or galvanostatically charged and discharged at various current densities in the voltage ranges of 2.5–4.0, 1.0–3.0 and 1.0–2.6 V, respectively (1 C=170 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> for all three samples).
