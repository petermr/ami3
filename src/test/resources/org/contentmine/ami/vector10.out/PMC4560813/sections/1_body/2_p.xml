<p>One of the critical issues needs to be addressed for efficient photo-charging of LIBs is to enhance the usually low current density and power-conversion efficiency associated with most current solar cells, particularly polymer solar cells. In this regard, the recent availability of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs)

Herein, we report the first use of PSC packs with four single CH

 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3</sub> PSCs connected in series for directly photo-charging LIBs assembled with a LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode and a Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> anode. The fabricated PSC–LIB units were shown to possess a high overall photo-electric conversion and storage efficiency of 7.80% and excellent cycling stability—outperformed all other reported LIBs, lithium–air batteries, flow batteries and super-capacitors integrated with a photo-charging component. This work clearly indicates that the PSC–LIB units developed in this study hold great promise for potential applications as self-chargeable batteries to power the BEVs and various portable electronics.
