<p>The solar cell technology that can generate electricity from the sunlight
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, could offer a viable approach to â€˜self-charging' of LIBs wherever needed. With the free and abundant sunlight that provides about 10,000 times more energy to the Earth than we consume, solar cells can ensure sustainable access to electrical power for charging LIBs anywhere around the world with no air pollution, hazardous waste or noise, and they requires little upkeep. If solar cells can be used for directly photo-charging LIBs, therefore, the BEV technology could be marketed for large-scale applications even without the presence of a cross-country network of charging stations. Although conceptually promising, photo-charging of batteries, including LIBs, with solar cells has been much less discussed than photo-charging super-capacitors and is far from practical so far (
