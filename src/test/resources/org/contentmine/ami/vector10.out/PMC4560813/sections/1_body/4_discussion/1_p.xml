<p>As can be seen from above, the solar cell technology offers a viable option to self-charge LIBs for potentially marketing the BEV technology for large-scale applications. However, all the photo-charging LIB devices reported to date exhibited a very low overall photo-electric storage-conversion efficiency and poor cycling stability (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We have, for the first time, demonstrated the use of PSC packs for directly photo-charging LIBs. The solar cell pack with four single CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3</sub> PSCs connected in series showed an outstanding solar-to-electric PCE of 12.65% (15.67% for the single cell), while the full LIB cell assembled with the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode and Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> anode exhibited a high specific capacity and rate capability. The fabricated PSCs–LIB units were demonstrated to possess a high photo-electric conversion and storage efficiency of 7.80% and excellent cycling stability under continued illumination with AM1.5G for 17.8 h. For practical applications, repeatable and reliable fabrication of the PSCs–LIB units with good performance is another important issue needs to be addressed. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5b, 6 and 10</xref> show a good repeatability for reliable fabrication of PSCs and integration of the resultant PSCs units for efficient photo-charging LIBs. In addition, an excellent discharge rate capability at various discharge rates was observed for the LFPO–LTO cell in the PSCs–LIB system (

To our best knowledge, the newly developed PSCs–LIB units outperformed all other reported LIBs, lithium–air batteries, flow batteries and super-capacitors integrated with a photo-charging component (
