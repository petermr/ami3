<p>To gain insights into the power-conversion and storage efficiencies, we calculated the overall photo-electric conversion efficiency of the fabricated PSCs–LIB system (
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) by dividing the discharge energy of the LFP–LTO cell shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> by the illumination energy (Method calculation 2). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3f</xref> (blue dots) shows a rather stable

 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> of 7.36% and an average 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> of 6.97% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Owing to a low potential polarization between the charge and discharge voltage plateaus at lower C-rates (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>), the PSCs–LIB exhibited an increased

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). To our best knowledge, the overall 7.80% photo-electric conversion efficiency (

 <sub>3</sub> of ∼71% and an average Coulombic efficiency of ∼99.5% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Clearly, therefore, the newly developed PSCs–LIB system possesses the highest
