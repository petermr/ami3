<p>In comparison, the galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles measured for fresh LFPO–Li, LTO–Li and LFPO–LTO cells at 0.5 C in the voltage ranges of 2.5–4.0, 1.0–3.0 and 1.0–2.6 V, respectively, for 30 cycles, using the automatic battery tester system as power supply (that is, PS), were given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. As expected, the fresh LFPO–LTO cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) using PS showed the similar charge–discharge 
 <italic>V</italic>–
 <italic>t</italic> curves to that of (PSCs and PS)-LIB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, the fresh cell delivered the initial, 11th, 15th and 30th reversible capacities of 141.6, 117.5, 115.5 and 115.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to an average capacity decay of 1.70% at the 10th cycle, 1.85% at the 15th cycle and 1.88% at the 30th cycle, during the galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, the cycling stability of LFPO–LTO cell was significantly improved after initial few cycles due to the enhanced compatibility between the electrode and electrolyte. Along with the almost identical electrochemical behaviour (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), the close discharge capacity and average capacity decay observed for both the PS-LIB and PSCs–LIB indicate, once again, the excellent photo-charging capability of the PSCs and high cycling stability of the LFPO–LTO LIBs.
