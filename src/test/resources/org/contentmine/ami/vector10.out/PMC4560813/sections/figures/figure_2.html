 <caption> Performance of PSCs and LIBs. ( a) J– V curve for single PSC. ( b) A typical J– V curve for the connected PSCs unit with four single PSCs connected in series. ( c) Rate capabilities of LFPO–Li, LTO–Li and LFPO–LTO cells measured at various C-rates (1 C=170 mA g −1) in the voltage ranges of 2.5–4.0, 1.0–3.0 and 1.0–2.6 V, respectively. ( d– f) Typical charge–discharge curves of ( d) LFPO–Li, ( e) LTO–Li and ( f) LFPO–LTO cells. </caption>
