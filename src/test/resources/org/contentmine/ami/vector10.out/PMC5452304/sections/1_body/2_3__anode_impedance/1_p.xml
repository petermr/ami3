<p>The growth of the passive surface layer on the anode creates resistance to lithium ion flow, which results in a rise in the charge transfer resistance and the impedance of the anode [

 <xref rid="B40-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This increase in anode impedance is said to increase with charge rate, cycle number, temperature, and anode material particle size [

 <xref rid="B43-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, at low temperatures (10–30 °C) and low charge rate(C/20), the anode electrode contribution to the overall battery impedance is low. This is attributed to the small amount of the surface film formed on the electrode surface [

Common surface reaction products formed on the anode surface include Li-alkyl carbonates, lithium carbonate species and fluorinated products. These products affect the intercalation and de-intercalation kinetics of the anode, and thus result in an increase in anode electrode impedance relative to the cathode [
