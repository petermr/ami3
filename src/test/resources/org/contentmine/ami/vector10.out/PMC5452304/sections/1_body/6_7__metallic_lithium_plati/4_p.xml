<p>The vulnerability of the anode electrode to degrade rapidly has prompted research to improve its stability. Several methods have been explored, including the inclusion of stabilizing compounds into the graphite matrix, formulations of dendrite and lithium plating suppression electrolyte systems. Elements such as Sn and carbon have been dispersed on the surface of the graphite to improve the electrochemical cycling properties of the anode electrode [

While a carbon black coating suppresses the delithiation process in the inner structure of the graphite at elevated temperature and thus improves cycle life and capacity fade [
