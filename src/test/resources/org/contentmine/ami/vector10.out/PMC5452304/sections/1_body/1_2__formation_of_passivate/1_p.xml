<p>Graphite is one of the common anode materials for lithium ion batteries operating in organic electrolytes, such as LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>, with co-solvents like ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), methyl ethyl carbonate (EMC)). The reaction of the anode with the electrolyte solution in the formation stage results in the formation of species such as ROCO
 <sub>2</sub>Li and CO
 <sub>2</sub>OLi, on the anode surface. The layer formed by these species is referred to as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The ROCO
 <sub>2</sub>Li can undergo reduction reaction with CO
 <sub>2</sub> and traces of H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the electrolyte to form lithium carbonate [

 <sup>âˆ’</sup> from HF and PF
 <sub>5</sub>, readily react with lithium to form insoluble reaction products which are non-uniform, electronically insulating, and unstable on the surface of the graphite particles [
