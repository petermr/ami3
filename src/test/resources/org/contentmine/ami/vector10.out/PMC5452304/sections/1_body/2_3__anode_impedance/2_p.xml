<p>Comparing the impedance of the anode is difficult owing to the multitude of testing conditions and different anode materials used in various batteries. However, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-06-01310-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b shows the impedances of the individual electrodes as well as the overall battery impedance. In these two cases, the anode contributes less to the overall battery impedance compared to the cathode. In these two cases, carbon is the anode material, while LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in EC+DMC is the electrolyte system and the operating conditions are low-to-medium temperature and low charge rate. The higher battery impedance exists at high operating temperature and charge rate, where the surface reactions are enhanced and a thicker surface film layer is formed on the electrode surface.
