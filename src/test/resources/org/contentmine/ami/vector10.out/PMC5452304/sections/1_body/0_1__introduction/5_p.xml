<p>Nevertheless, the anode has been associated with many aging mechanisms in the lithium ion battery. The focus of this paper is to elucidate the various aging mechanisms occurring at the anode of the lithium ion battery. Although the main focus will be on the aging mechanisms, a brief analysis of various treatment measures adopted to mitigate these aging mechanisms on the anode will be discussed.</p>
