<p>By design, the anode electrode has a large geometry dimension compared to the cathode electrode so as to prevent edge lithium plating at the anode ends. Also, the anode electrode generally has excess anode capacity compared to the cathode so that the battery can deliver high energy density [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-06-01310" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A reduced anode capacity will polarize the anode to a potential close to lithium deposition potentials. However, higher surface area of the electrode is preferred to active surface area, since a higher surface allows short diffusion paths for lithium ions between the graphite particles; this facilitates fast charge and discharge rate and improves the capacity of the battery. Decrease particles size tends to increase the specific surface area from BET (Brunauer Emmett and Teller) method and the irreversible capacity loss increases. On the other hand, irreversible capacity decreases as the active specific area of the electrode increases. The intercalation of lithium ions into the graphite sheets at various stages, e.g., Li
