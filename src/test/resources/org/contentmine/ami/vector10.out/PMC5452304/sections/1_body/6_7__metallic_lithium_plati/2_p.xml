<p>There are several factors that initiate the formation of metallic lithium on the surface of the anode electrode, some of these include: (1) the nature of the electrolyte (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, electrolyte formulations with high EC content exhibit lithium plating); (2) the ratio between anode and cathode capacities (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, low anode/capacity ratio will polarize the anode and promote lithium plating); (3) the operating temperature and the charge rate [
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, low temperature (−20 °C) and high charge rate] all influence plating on the anode [
