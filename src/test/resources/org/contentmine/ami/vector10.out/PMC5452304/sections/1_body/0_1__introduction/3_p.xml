<p>The anode undergoes a multitude of aging mechanisms that degrade the electrochemical performance of the lithium ion battery. The most commonly used anode materials include carbon-based compounds and lithium-alloys. The microstructure, texture, crystallinity and morphology of the anode material directly influence its performance [
