<p>The anode of the lithium ion battery undergoes several degradation mechanisms during aging. Lithium plating is one aging mechanism which ends the life of a battery more rapidly due to the formation and growth of lithium dendrites. The decomposition of the electrolyte and subsequent formation of the film surface layer on the anode, cause an increase in the impedance and the consumption of recyclable lithium ions. These degradation mechanisms rarely affect the crystal structure of the anode electrode. The addition of various stabilizers, robust electrolyte systems, and temperature treatment are some of the methods that have been adopted to mitigate these aging effects on the electrode. However, further improvement is still needed to build a more robust anode that can deliver high energy density and good cycleability at various operating conditions. </p>
