<p>The resulting plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> shows the per cent volumetric change versus the SOC for the electrode sub-sections at varying distances from the separator. In agreement with our findings from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, we find that both electrodes expand (contract) by âˆ¼6% on average (blue curves) during the course of lithiation (delithiation). Furthermore, we find that (i) the delithiating top electrode contracts progressively along the TP direction, starting from the section closest to the separator and then towards the current collector, and (ii) the lithiating bottom electrode shows a homogeneous expansion throughout the entire electrode up to about 50% SOC followed by a progressive expansion of portions of the electrode beginning with the section closest to the separator.
