<p>We further determine that within the graphite electrodes, microstructural changes occur predominantly along the TP direction. The IP vector field components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>) are on the order of only 1–2 μm (arrows are scaled by a factor 60), while the TP vector field components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) represent an average displacement of 10–20 μm (scaling factor 8). The origin of this is twofold: first graphite expands predominantly along its 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis, which corresponds to the shortest dimension of the active particles. As most particles align with their flat side parallel to the current collector (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, the electrode will favour expansion along the TP direction. Second, from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> (vector arrows scaled by a factor of 8), the cell housing constrains further expansion in the IP directions.
