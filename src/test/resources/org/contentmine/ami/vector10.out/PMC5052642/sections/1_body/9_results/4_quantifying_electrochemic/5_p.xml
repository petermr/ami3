<p>To further quantify these observations, we slice the electrodes along planes at equidistantly spaced positions in the TP direction and spatially integrate the divergences of the displacement fields within each of the resulting cylindrical sub-volumes for all time steps. This provides the relative volumetric changes of the electrode sub-sections as a function of the flowed specific charge:</p>
