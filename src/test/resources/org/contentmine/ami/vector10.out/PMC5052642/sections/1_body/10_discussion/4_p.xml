<p>To lithiate the high capacity SiC electrode without the risk of plating on a similar time scale as the graphite electrode, we apply 10 mV potentiostatic conditions right from the beginning until the current has dropped to an effective C/20 rate and the flowed electric charge has reached 93% of the theoretical electrode capacity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref> summarizes the flowed electric charge and the voltage as a function of time. The blue bars indicate the tomographic scans, which are acquired approximately every 20 min.
