  <inline-graphic id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms12909-i1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>Tomographic imaging of graphite-based anodes is challenging due to weak X-ray attenuation contrast. Here, the authors use operando propagation-based phase contrast tomography and digital volume correlation to study the electrochemical activity and microstructural dynamics in (siliconâˆ’) graphite electrodes.
