<p>For the graphite–graphite cell, a 1.5 mm pristine graphite electrode was placed facing the bottom current collector, followed by a 250 μm glass fibre separator immersed in 20 μl standard LP30 electrolyte (BASF, 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in EC:DMC=1:1 by weight) and a pre-lithiated graphite electrode from the coin cell facing the top current collector.
