<p>Here we present 
 <italic>operando</italic> tomography measurements of graphite electrodes during (de)lithiation. Using PPC and optimizing the ratio 
 <italic>δ</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> only slightly compromises the effective resolution while allowing for improved contrast needed for binarization. DVC enables us to quantify the electrochemical activity throughout the electrodes, and, in combination with PPC, to perform a dynamic microstructure analysis. After validating this approach using well-studied graphite electrodes, we show that it can be applied to study the lithiation dynamics and structural evolution of graphite-silicon composite anodes for the next generation of LIBs.
