<p>Having validated our approach with graphite electrodes, we apply it to study electrodes containing graphite blended with small amounts of silicon (SiC electrodes). SiC electrodes have recently found widespread attention as a solution that enhances the specific charge capacity of the electrode (silicon exhibits a one order of magnitude higher specific charge capacity (3578, mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)) than graphite (372 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>)), while limiting the volumetric changes of the electrode on electrochemical operation

SiC electrodes present similar challenges as graphite electrodes for dynamic imaging in 3D, but, unlike for graphite electrodes, the distribution of electrochemical activity and microstructural dynamics in SiC electrodes are not well understood. Due to the large volumetric change of silicon on (de)lithiation, mechanical deformation within SiC electrodes is expected to be (i) overall significantly stronger and (ii) more heterogeneous compared with pure graphite electrodes.
