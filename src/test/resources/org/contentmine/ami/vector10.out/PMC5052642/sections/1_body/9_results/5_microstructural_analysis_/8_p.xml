 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref> shows the absolute and relative values of the tortuosity along the two IP and the TP direction as a function of time. These values have been calculated on a smaller dynamic volume (initial size: 350 × 350 × 250 voxels
 <sup>3</sup>=227.5 × 227.5 × 162.5 μm
 <sup>3</sup>), which is sufficiently large for variations due to spatial inhomogeneities in the microstructure to not influence the result (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). The large anisotropy (factor of two) between the IP tortuosities and the TP tortuosity arises from the fact that the graphite particles are platelet shaped and tend to align with their flat-side parallel to the current collector, which results in significantly longer diffusion paths along the TP direction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, while the TP tortuosity is constant over time, the IP tortuosities increase by ∼2% during the course of lithiation. This effect could arise from the graphite platelets expanding predominately along their c-axis direction, thereby narrowing the diffusion paths along the IP directions. Again, as the rate of electrode expansion overtakes the rate of particle expansion (above 50% SOC), the IP tortuosities no longer increase.
