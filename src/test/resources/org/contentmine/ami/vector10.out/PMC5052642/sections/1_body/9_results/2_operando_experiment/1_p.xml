 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), while the lithium ions are electrochemically moved from the top to the bottom electrode at an effective C/7 rate until the cut-off potential at −1.5 V is reached. We use a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique protocol
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, where 57 s long current pulses alternate with 3 s long open circuit relaxation times. A potentiostatic step at the cut-off potential is added to ensure that all lithium ions migrate between the electrodes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref> shows corresponding subsections of vertical cuts through the tomograms at different states of charge (SOC). The SOC is computed by dividing the measured charge by the active mass of graphite multiplied with the theoretical capacity of LiC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). On lithiation, the bottom electrode has slightly expanded in the through-plane (TP) direction, while the top electrode has contracted in the same direction on delithiation. This is in agreement with our understanding from literature that graphite reversibly expands by approximately 10.5% on full lithium intercalation
