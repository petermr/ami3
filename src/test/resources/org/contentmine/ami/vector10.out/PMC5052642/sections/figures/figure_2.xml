   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the two electrodes, the separator (black) and the cuts C1, C2, and C3 (purple). The coordinate system indicates the two IP directions and the TP direction. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Top electrode with superimposed vector field indicating the IP electrode contraction from the first to the last time step (vectors are scaled by a factor 60). Scale bar length, 300 μm. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Analogue graphic for the bottom electrode. Vectors point outwards, indicating an expansion. Scale bar length, 300 μm. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Zoom-ins showing the full vector field resolution within the boundary regime (orange box, vectors rescaled by a factor 8) and within a central part in the electrode (blue box, vectors rescaled by a factor 80). Scale bar length, 100 μm. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Vertical cut through both electrodes and the separator with superimposed vector field (vectors scaled by a factor 8). Scale bar length, 300 μm.
