<p>For the silicon graphite mixed electrodes, a combination of 2.4 g graphite (same kind), 0.8 g amorphous/polycrystalline silicon powder (Alpha Aesar, 1–20 μm), 8 g 5 wt% PVDF binder in NMP (same kind) and 0.4 g Carbon Black (same kind) in 6 g NMP was used (weight ratio 60/20/10/10 wt%, 1174, mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> theoretical specific charge capacity). Preparation conditions were the same except for the electrode thickness, which was adjusted to 140 μm.
