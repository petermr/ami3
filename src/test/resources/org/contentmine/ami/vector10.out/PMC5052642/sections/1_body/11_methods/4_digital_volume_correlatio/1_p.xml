<p>DVC on the graphite–graphite sample was performed on the full reconstructed data sets with the commercial software DaVis8 (LaVision GmbH, Germany), using the direct correlation algorithm with multiple iterations: 6 passes with 256 voxel window size, 48 voxel peak search radius, 8 × 8 × 8 binning, 50% window overlap; 7 passes with 128 voxel window size, 48 voxel peak search radius, 8 × 8 × 8 binning, 50% window overlap and 8 passes with 64 voxel window size, 16 voxel peak search radius, 4 × 4 × 4 binning, 50% window overlap.</p>
