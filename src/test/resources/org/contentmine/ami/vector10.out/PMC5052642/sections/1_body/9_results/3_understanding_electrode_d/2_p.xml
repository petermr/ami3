<p>To obtain a qualitative picture of electrode dynamics, we look at cuts C1, C2 and C3 through the electrodes, as indicated by the magenta planes in the sketch in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the horizontal slice C2 through the middle of the top electrode with the superimposed vector field correlating the first with the last scan. Vector arrows point towards an anchor point close to the middle of the electrode, indicating that the electrode contracts within the plane parallel to the current collector (in-plane directions, IP
 <sub>1</sub> &amp; IP
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) on delithiation. In contrast, for a slice C3 through the bottom electrode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), the arrows point outwards, indicating that the electrode expands in the IP directions during lithiation. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref> shows the displacement field throughout the whole stack. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref> shows magnifications of the image data and the displacement field in the full computationally available spatial resolution (one vector arrow in 32 × 32 × 32 voxels
 <sup>3</sup>). The domain taken from the electrode edge (orange box) reveals that the cell housing blocks expansion of the electrode in the IP direction and the domain from the centre of the electrode (blue box) shows a weak random displacement field at the particle scale superimposed on the radial fields describing the overall volumetric changes of the electrode. This indicates that particles and pores of the microstructure slightly deform and reorder with respect to one another during the course of (de)lithiation. The dipole shaped vector field superimposed on the vertical cut C1 through both electrodes and the separator (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) complements the observations from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref> in the TP direction: the glass fibre separator moves upwards, the top electrode contracts, and the bottom electrode expands. The overall volume of the sample remains almost unaffected on a full (de)lithiation, which is expected because of the symmetric cell design and the conservation of charge and mass within the sample.
