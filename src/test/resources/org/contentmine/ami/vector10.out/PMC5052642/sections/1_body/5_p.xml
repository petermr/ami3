<p>To investigate dynamic lithium distribution and microstructure evolution, we propose a twofold approach. First, we apply digital volume correlation (DVC)â€”previously used to study two-dimensional (2D) strains in graphite electrodes using an optical cell

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>- to the time-resolved set of tomographic data to precisely track even small deformations within the graphite electrodes as function of three-dimensional (3D) space and time. On the basis of these morphological changes, the electrochemical activity may be mapped throughout the electrodes. While a major advantage of DVC when applied to weakly attenuating materials is that it does not rely on error-prone data binarization procedures, binarization remains necessary for microstructural analysis.
