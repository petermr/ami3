<p>The sample was placed in the beam, 5 cm away from the scintillator to enhance phase contrast. For each scan, 1,201 projections were acquired at 25 keV±2% beam energy using 600 ms integration time per projection, which resulted in 29 scans with a measurement time of ∼17 min each. Using a 10 × microscope and a sCMOS camera with 2560 × 1200 pixels readout, the entire cell (excluding the cell housing wall) could be fit in the resulting 1664 μm × 780 μm field of view with 0.65 μm × 0.65 μm pixel size (local tomography). To ensure comparability between the different scans without the need for image registration techniques, the sample remained mounted in the sample stage in the very same position at all times.</p>
