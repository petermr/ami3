<p>In all cases, we used circular shaped interrogation windows and universal outlier detection (remove threshold 2, insert threshold 3, epsilon=0.1, 3 × 3 × 3 neighbourhood). The resulting vector field was smoothed with a Gaussian filter in a 3 × 3 × 3 neighbourhood. For the sketches in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2b,c,e</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4a</xref>, the fields were computed with lower resolution for better visibility.
