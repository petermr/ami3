 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> shows the results superimposed on IP and TP cuts through the electrode. We observe a pronounced and clear correlation between material type and expansion characteristic: the domains of strongest expansion (up to 65%) coincide with the positions of the silicon particles. The graphite particles, pore space, and separator expand less or are even compressed by the expanding silicon domains.
