<p>Needle-shaped specimens for APT analysis were prepared by lift-out procedure using an FEI Helios 600 Nanolab focused-ion-beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM). Li

 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were dispersed on a Si substrate; individual nanoparticles were lifted out by contact with OmniProbe nanomanipulator and transferred onto a Si microtip array. Once the nanoparticles were placed on top of Si microtips, electron-beam-assisted Pt deposition was used to coat the individual nanoparticles. All manipulation of nanoparticles and Pt deposition were done using only the electron beam without Ga-ion beam imaging. After Pt deposition, the nanoparticles were subjected to annular milling using Ga-ion beam to form the final needle specimens of the nanoparticles attached to the Si microtip array. If cavities were observed between a nanoparticle and the Si microtip, electron-beam-assisted Pt deposition was also performed during annular milling. Initial annular milling was conducted at 30 kV and final milling was performed using 2 kV to minimize Ga contamination in the final needle specimen. A schematic of the specimen preparation method is given in
