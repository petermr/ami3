<p>Oxygen is known to be deficient during laser-assisted APT analysis of oxides except at extremely low laser energies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. To verify the accuracy of the APT quantification, the measured concentrations of Li, Mn and Ni were renormalized independently of O and compared with the expected composition. In stoichiometric Li
 <sub>1.2</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.2</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.6</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, the Li fraction of the total cations, Li/(Li+Mn+Ni), should be 0.6; Mn, 0.3; and Ni, 0.1. The measured cation fractions were 0.647, 0.258 and 0.095, respectively. The concentration these specimens will be a function of the volume fraction of Ni-rich and Mn-rich regions sampled within the reconstruction, which may account for the minor variation from the expected stoichiometry. The APT reconstruction from layered-LNMO is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f–i)</xref>. The non-uniform spatial distribution of Mn (blue) and Ni (green) ions shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> is comparable to EDS maps shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>. The ion map showing Li (yellow) with Ni (green) highlights the similarity of the spatial distribution of Li and Mn. Both Li and Mn segregate away from regions of Ni enrichment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The O (red) and Mn (blue) ion map shows O segregating to regions with Ni enrichment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). A 13 at % Ni isocomposition surface image, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>, highlights regions enriched in Ni distributed throughout the reconstructed volume. The compositional partitioning across the Ni- and Mn-rich regions was quantified using a proximity histogram calculated perpendicular to the 13 at % Ni isocomposition surface
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>). From the steady-state regions on either side of the interface in proximity histogram, the concentration of Ni-rich region was estimated to be 21.92±0.83 at% Li, 12.89±0.67 at% Mn, 22.65±0.84 at % Ni and 42.53±0.99 at % O and the Mn-rich regions had a concentration of 42.94±0.29 at % Li, 16.91±0.22 at % Mn, 5.69±0.14 at % Ni and 34.36±0.28 at % O. The Ni:Mn ratios in the Ni-rich region and Mn-rich region correspond to 1.76 and 0.34, respectively. These Ni:Mn ratios are considerably higher than those previously obtained from Mn- or Ni-rich regions with STEM-EELS measurements, but two-dimensional (2D) STEM-based maps are measured in projection and thus an average of the composition through the thickness of the LMNO particle. The truly 3D measurements made by APT would therefore be expected to yield a higher maximum Ni:Mn ratio in 3D Ni- or Mn-rich regions.
