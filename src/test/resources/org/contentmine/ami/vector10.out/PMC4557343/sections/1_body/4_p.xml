<p>The common obstacle to using these materials is capacity and voltage fading, believed to be closely related to a gradual structural evolution, governed by the spatial distribution of Li ions and their correlation with other ions in the lattice. Therefore, one of the great challenges facing the development of these high-voltage cathode materials for Li-ion batteries is to locate the spatial distribution of ions with sub-nanometre-scale spatial resolution. Aberration-corrected scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> have been used to spatially map the transition metal cations within Li-ion battery cathodes, but these techniques do not have sufficient sensitivity to map Li at sub-nanometre scales, especially in three-dimensional (3D). Atom probe tomography (APT) is uniquely capable of providing quantitative 3D, sub-nanometre-scale compositional characterization of oxides and composites
