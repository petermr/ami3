<p>The Li segregation to Mn-rich, Ni-depleted regions in as-fabricated layered-LNMO suggests a Li

 <sub>3</sub> phase with only minor Ni. The Ni-enriched regions with lower Li concentration can be attributed to a Li(Ni
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.5</sub>)O
 <sub>2</sub> phase. These APT results are consistent with STEMâ€“EDS results from the same materials

 <sub>3</sub> (C2/m) having varying amounts of Li, Mn, and Ni in each of these phases. Partitioning of Li, Ni, and Mn can lead to variation of local electrochemical properties. Recently, it was demonstrated that the capacity fading in layered-LNMO is closely related to the Ni distribution
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, but those results lacked information about the Li distribution. It is plausible that the local depletion of Li leads to partial deactivation of a particle with cycling, which may contribute to the capacity and voltage fading. APT results from the cycled LNMO provide evidence for Li loss. Partial segregation of Li, Mn and Ni to different regions in the cycled layered-LNMO is shown along with an increased extent of phase separation of Li, Mn and O.
