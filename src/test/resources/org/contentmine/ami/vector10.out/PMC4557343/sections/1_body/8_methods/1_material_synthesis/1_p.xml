<p>Li
 <sub>1.2</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.2</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.6</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was synthesized by wet chemical process as described briefly here. Nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO
 <sub>4</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O), manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and ammonium hydroxide (NH
 <sub>3</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O) were used as the starting materials to prepare Ni
 <sub>0.25</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.75</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> precursor. The precursor material was washed with hot water to remove residual sodium and sulfuric species, then filtered and dried inside a vacuum oven set at 80 °C for 24 h. Ni
 <sub>0.25</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.75</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> was mixed well with Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and then calcined at 900 C for 15 h to form the cathode materials. Detailed experimental set-up for the synthesis of the materials was reported in Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. A facile solid-state reaction method, which is easy to scale up for mass production, was adopted to synthesize the spinel LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. In detail, LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> was prepared by ball milling a mixture of Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, NiO and MnCO
 <sub>3</sub> (all from Aldrich) in stoichiometric amount for 4 h followed by calcination at 900 °C for 24 h in air with the heating rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and cooling rate of 5 °C min
