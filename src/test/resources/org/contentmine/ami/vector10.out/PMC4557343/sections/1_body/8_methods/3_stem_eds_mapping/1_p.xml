<p>The STEM and EDS mapping was performed using an FEI Tecnai Osiris microscope at 200â€‰kV. The samples were dispersed onto a holey-carbon TEM grid and imaged accordingly. The FEI Tecnai Osiris microscope is equipped with a state-of-the-art Super-X EDS detector system, which allows efficient and fast mapping at nanoscale.</p>
