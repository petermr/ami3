  <title>Dispersed infrared pump-probe and absorptive 2D infrared spectra.</title>
  <p>Time-and-frequency-resolved infrared pump-probe data of pure DEC liquid (
   <bold>a</bold>) and 1.0 M LiPF
   <sub>6</sub> DEC solution (
   <bold>b</bold>) are plotted. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Four 2D infrared spectra of 1.0 M LiPF
   <sub>6</sub> DEC solution at different waiting times are shown, where each 2D infrared spectrum was normalized to the positive peak maximum value. The 
   <italic>x</italic> and 
   <italic>y</italic> axes are the infrared frequency of the pump (excitation) and probe (emission) fields, respectively. In these contour plot, red (blue) colour represent positive (negative) sign.
