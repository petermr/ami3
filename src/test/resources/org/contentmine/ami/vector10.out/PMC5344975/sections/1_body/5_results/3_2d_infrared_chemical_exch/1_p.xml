 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref> shows four representative time-resolved 2D infrared spectra of C=O stretch mode of DEC in 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> DEC solution at different waiting times. Each 2D infrared spectrum was normalized to the largest positive 0–1 peak magnitude. At a very short waiting time of 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>=0.3 ps, there are only two peaks on the diagonal line (see the upper-left panel in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), which correspond to the two absorption peaks in the FTIR spectrum shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>. The positive peaks (red colour) result from the ground state bleaching and stimulated emission contributions, whereas the negative peaks (blue colour) in the lower frequency region along the probe frequency (
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sub>t</sub>) axis are the excited state absorption contributions. Both positive and negative peaks are elongated along the diagonal line at short waiting time up to 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>=1.0 ps. However, after 2.0 ps, all peaks become round in shape due to the spectral diffusion process. Diagonally elongated peaks at short waiting times indicate structural heterogeneity, distribution of coordination number and ethyl side-chain conformational distribution (

 <sup>+</sup>. We found that the C=O stretch frequency–frequency correlation decays on a few picosecond timescale, which could result from ultrafast internal rotations of the ethyl groups in DEC and hindered rotational motions of carbonates.
