<p>Here we show evidence on the ultrafast formation and dissociation dynamics of Li–carbonate solvation complexes in the LIB electrolyte solutions by analysing the FTIR spectra and time-resolved infrared pump-probe and 2D infrared data of C=O stretch modes in lithium salt electrolyte solutions and carrying out quantum chemistry calculations. In particular, the time constant associated with the breaking of Li
 <sup>+</sup>···DEC electrostatic interaction is found to be 2.2 ps and that with the formation of the Li
 <sup>+</sup>···DEC bond is 17.5 ps at 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentration in DEC solvent. The timescales of making and breaking of Li
 <sup>+</sup>···DMC interaction bonds in PC/DMC mixed solvents are similar to those for DEC solutions, which indicates that the DMC molecules also participate in the formation of lithium cation solvation shell even in such mixed electrolyte solutions used in a real LIB. We anticipate that such ultrafast fluxional dynamics in solvation shell structures around lithium cations are of importance in understanding lithium-ion mobility in LIB solutions.
