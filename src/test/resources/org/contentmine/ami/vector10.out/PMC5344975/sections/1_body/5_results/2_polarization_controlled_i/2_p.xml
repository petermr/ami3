<p>Vibrational lifetime of Li–DEC complex (1.1±0.1 ps) is found to be much shorter than that of free DEC (2.1±0.1 ps). Detailed discussion on the origin of such increased vibrational relaxation rate of DEC upon its electrostatic interaction with Li

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>. The anisotropic infrared pump-probe signals of free DEC and Li–DEC enabled us to determine the orientational relaxation rates. As expected, the Li–DEC complex with three or four DEC molecules with or without ion-pairing PF

 <sup>−</sup> rotates slowly as compared to free DEC and the second-order rotational correlation time constants are found to be 8.3±0.6 ps and 1.5±0.1 ps for Li–DEC complex and free DEC, respectively.
