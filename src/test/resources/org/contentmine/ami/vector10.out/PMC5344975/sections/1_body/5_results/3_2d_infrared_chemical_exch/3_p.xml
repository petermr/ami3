<p>In a real LIB electrolyte solution, detailed solvation dynamics around Li
 <sup>+</sup> could be affected by the presence of co-solvents in the first solvation shell. In a recent 
 <sup>17</sup>O NMR experiment, NMR peak of carbonyl oxygen atom in EC or DMC shows a motional narrowing behaviour, indicating the existence of fast equilibrium dynamics between free carbonate and Li-complexed carbonate molecules in nanosecond or even shorter timescales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, it has long been believed that such fast solvent exchange dynamics can occur only in the second solvation shell because of the belief that the first solvation shell maintains its rigid structure during the Li-transport between electrodes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, if Li-solvent complexes undergo fast solvent exchange dynamics resulting in ultrafast fluctuation of coordination number and solvation structure, the conventional view on the robust and rigid solvation sheath formation must be reconsidered. Especially the coordination number fluctuation would modulate the diffusion rate of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in LIB electrolyte solutions. To date, however, little has been understood about how fast the solvation dynamics and the structural fluctuation of solvation sheath.
