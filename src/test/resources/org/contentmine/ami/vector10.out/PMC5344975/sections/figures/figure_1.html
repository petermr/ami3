 <caption> Home-built thin infrared sample cell and FTIR spectra. ( a) RF magnetron sputtering method was used to deposit a thin donut-shape SiO 2 film on CaF 2. The thickness of SiO 2 film on CaF 2 was measured with scanning electron microscopy (right panel). Scale bar, 500 nm. ( b) The linear relationship between the sputtering time and the thickness of SiO 2 film was used to control the infrared beam path length. ( c) The FT-IR spectra of the C=O stretch and ( d) the O–C–O asymmetric stretch of LiPF 6 DEC solution at various LiPF 6 concentrations. </caption>
