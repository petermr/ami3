<p>In principle, the inhomogeneous structural distribution can be studied by analysing the centre or nodal line slope and/or diagonal ellipticities of 2D infrared peaks

Unfortunately, due to the destructive interference between the positive 0–1 peak from Li–DEC and the negative 1–2 peak from free DEC, it is difficult to clearly identify the corresponding 2D infrared feature. Thus, we compared the infrared absorption linewidths of free DEC and Li–DEC complex with the help of pump-probe data. The FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) of the infrared spectrum of Li–DEC is found to be 22.2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is slightly broader than that of free DEC (FWHM=18.9 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, the vibrational lifetime of Li–DEC is just half of that of the free DEC, which means that the lifetime broadening of Li–DEC is larger than that of free DEC. These observations indicate that the inhomogeneous linewidth of Li–DEC may be narrower than free DEC, which is consistent with the notion that DEC molecules in Li–DEC complexes have stable conformers and the side-chain structure can be correlated with its solvation property
