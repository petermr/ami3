<p>In the present work, the carbonyl stretch mode of DEC was used as the infrared probe for monitoring any local change and dynamics of Li-solvation sheath. Since the infrared chromophore, DEC, is also solvent, the transmittance of infrared beam is very low so that an infrared sample holder with extremely narrow path length was needed. Previously, to overcome a similar difficulty, Cowan 
 <italic>et al</italic>. used a ultra-thin sample cell consisting of 2 mm × 2 mm window of 800 nm-thick Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> for 2D infrared study of pure water, where the effective thickness of water flow channel was controlled to be 500 nm (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Here to make an infrared sample cell and holder for the commercially available FT-IR spectrometer and subsequent 2D infrared measurements, we used SiO
 <sub>2</sub> to coat on the 25 mm diameter CaF
 <sub>2</sub> window (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Here SiO
 <sub>2</sub> was selected because it is chemically non-reactive and also it is strongly adhesive to CaF
 <sub>2</sub>. RF (radio frequency) magnetron sputtering system (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) was used with three-inch diameter high-purity SiO
 <sub>2</sub> target. The thickness of sputtered SiO
 <sub>2</sub> layer on CaF
 <sub>2</sub> surface was verified by scanning electron microscopy and used the linear relationship between the sputtering time and the thickness of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> layer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the infrared pump-probe and 2D infrared measurements, to minimize the re-absorption of the generated third-order infrared signal electric field, that is, self-attenuation problem, the absorbance of DEC carbonyl stretching mode was adjusted to be less than 0.4, which was achieved by using 800 nm path length. All the infrared spectra were measured on Jasco 6300 FV spectrometer with a circulating water bath for temperature control. This spectrometer is equipped with a DLATGS detector with Peltier element in the absorbance mode range from 450 to 7,800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with frequency resolution of 0.07 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. During the measurements, N
 <sub>2</sub> gas is purged to suppress any vapour noise and to minimize undesired water condensation on the CaF
 <sub>2</sub> window.
