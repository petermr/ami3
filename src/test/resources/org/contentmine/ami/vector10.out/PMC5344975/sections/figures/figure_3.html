 <caption> Dispersed infrared pump-probe and absorptive 2D infrared spectra. Time-and-frequency-resolved infrared pump-probe data of pure DEC liquid ( a) and 1.0 M LiPF 6 DEC solution ( b) are plotted. ( c) Four 2D infrared spectra of 1.0 M LiPF 6 DEC solution at different waiting times are shown, where each 2D infrared spectrum was normalized to the positive peak maximum value. The x and y axes are the infrared frequency of the pump (excitation) and probe (emission) fields, respectively. In these contour plot, red (blue) colour represent positive (negative) sign. </caption>
