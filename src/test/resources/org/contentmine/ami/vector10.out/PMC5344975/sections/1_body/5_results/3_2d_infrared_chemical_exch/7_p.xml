<p>Although our experimental observations clearly show the ultrafast chemical exchange dynamics in lithium-ion solvation sheath, we still need to consider another possibility that the increasing cross peaks could result from vibrational excitation transfers between free DEC and Liâ€“DEC complex. Indeed, the vibration energy transfer between donor and acceptor molecules with different transition frequencies can produce cross peaks of which intensities increase in time

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Unlike the case of chemical exchange-induced cross peaks, the increase rate of the upper-left cross peak intensity should differ from that of the lower-right cross peak intensity, because they are produced by up- and down-hill transitions, respectively.
