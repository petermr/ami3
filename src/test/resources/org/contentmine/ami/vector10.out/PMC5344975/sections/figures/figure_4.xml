  <title>Equilibrium structure and kinetic analysis of 2D infrared spectrum.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) A schematic picture on the chemical equilibrium between two solvation structures. The left consists of Li-complex with three bound DECs and one free DEC, whereas the right represents the tetra-coordinated Liâ€“DEC complex. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The time-dependent diagonal and cross peak volumes obtained from the experimentally measured 2D infrared spectra are plotted. The fitted (solid) curves are also shown here.
