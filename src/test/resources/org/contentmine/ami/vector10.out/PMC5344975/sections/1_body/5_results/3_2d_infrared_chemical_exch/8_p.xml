<p>Unfortunately, the lower-right positive cross peak in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> overlaps with the negative diagonal peak from the free DEC, which obscures the time-dependent features of the cross peaks. We thus compared the time-dependent increase of the upper-left positive cross peak and that of the lower-right negative peak, assuming that the chemical exchange dynamics of DECs (either free DEC or Li–DEC complex) in their excited states are similar to those in their ground states. To rule out the possibility that the 2D infrared cross peaks originate from vibrational excitation transfers between free DEC and Li–DEC complex, we further carried out a series of concentration-dependent pump-probe measurements at four different LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentrations in the range from 0.2 to 1.0 M (detailed analysis on pump-probe results are found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). A decrease in LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentration would significantly reduce the chance for a free DEC to encounter Li-complexed DEC molecules. This should result in an increase of vibrational lifetime of free DEC, if the vibrational energy transfer between free DEC and complex DEC occurs within a few picosecond timescale. However, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, the vibrational lifetime of free DEC is independent of LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentration. This confirms that the cross peaks observed in our 2D infrared spectra originate from ultrafast chemical exchange processes in the solvation sheath of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in DEC electrolyte solution.
