 <sup>+</sup> cation, in LIB
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Because Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion mobility is much lower than electrons in metal wires, the solvation dynamics of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in electrolyte solutions is crucial in determining the LIB performance. Typical electrolyte solutions used in LIB are composed of non-aqueous carbonate solvents that have certain advantages. For instance, the oxidation potential can be matched to the output voltage of LIB and carbonate solvents are also building blocks of solid-electrolyte interphase
