<p>Despite that the 2D infrared spectra appear to be spectrally congested, we could clearly observe real-time chemical exchange processes between Li–DMC

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>. All four representative 2D infrared spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> show four diagonal peaks, where the two in the lower frequency region at around 1,725 and 1,760 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are associated with the C=O stretch modes of Li–DMC and free DMC molecules, respectively, and the two in the higher-frequency region at around 1,780 and 1,800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> originate from the C=O stretch modes of Li–PC and free PC molecules (the FTIR spectra of three different mixed solvent systems (i)–(iii) can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).
