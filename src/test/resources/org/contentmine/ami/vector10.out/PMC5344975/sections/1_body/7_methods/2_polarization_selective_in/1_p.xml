<p>Experimental details of pump-probe and 2D infrared spectroscopy employed in the present study have been described elsewhere. Briefly, 800 nm pulses with duration of ∼100 fs and 1.0 mJ were generated from Ti:Sapphire oscillator and regenerative amplifier operating at 1 KHz, which were then used to produce near- infrared pulses at ∼1.4 and ∼1.9 μm. With AgGaS nonlinear optical crystal, the signal and idler pulses are mixed to generate mid-infrared pulses with ∼8 μJ per pulse and ∼100 fs duration centred at 2,070 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. For polarization-selective infrared pump-probe measurements, wire grid polarizers were used to set the polarization directions of the pump and probe beams to be 45° and 0° before the sample. The probe beam was resolved after the sample to either +45° (parallel) or −45° (perpendicular) by a linear polarizer on a computer-controlled rotator, sent through a polarizer fixed to 0° into the spectrograph, and detected by a 32-element array detector.
