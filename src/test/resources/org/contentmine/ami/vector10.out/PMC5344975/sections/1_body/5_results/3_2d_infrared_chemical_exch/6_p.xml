<p>Equilibrium population ratio between free DEC and DEC···Li
 <sup>+</sup>(ligands)
 <sub>n–1</sub> can be obtained from the infrared spectral peak analyses after extracting information on the corresponding transition dipole ratio from the LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentration-dependent infrared data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). The transition dipole strength of DEC···Li
 <sup>+</sup>(ligands)
 <sub>n–1</sub> is 1.7 times larger than that of free DEC, which is in excellent agreement with quantum chemistry calculation results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table 2</xref>). With the experimentally measured transition dipole ratio of 1.7, the population ratio of DEC···Li
 <sup>+</sup>(ligands)
 <sub>n–1</sub> to DEC is found to be 0.138, that is, [DEC···Li
 <sup>+</sup>(ligands)
 <sub>n–1</sub>]/[free DEC]=0.138. From the peak volumes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) obtained through a 2D Gaussian fitting analysis of 2D infrared spectrum, the time-dependent concentrations of free DEC and Li–DEC complex were obtained. All the other parameters required in the present volume fitting analyses of 2D infrared data were obtained from the FTIR and infrared pump-probe measurements. The two-state-model fit curves shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Finally, it is found that the time constant associated with the breaking of Li
 <sup>+</sup>···DEC is 2.2 ps and that with the formation of one Li
 <sup>+</sup>···DEC bond is 17.5 ps at 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> concentration.
