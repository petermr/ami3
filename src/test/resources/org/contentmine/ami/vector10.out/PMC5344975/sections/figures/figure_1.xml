  <title>Home-built thin infrared sample cell and FTIR spectra.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) RF magnetron sputtering method was used to deposit a thin donut-shape SiO
   <sub>2</sub> film on CaF
   <sub>2</sub>. The thickness of SiO
   <sub>2</sub> film on CaF
   <sub>2</sub> was measured with scanning electron microscopy (right panel). Scale bar, 500 nm. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The linear relationship between the sputtering time and the thickness of SiO
   <sub>2</sub> film was used to control the infrared beam path length. (
   <bold>c</bold>) The FT-IR spectra of the C=O stretch and (
   <bold>d</bold>) the O–C–O asymmetric stretch of LiPF
   <sub>6</sub> DEC solution at various LiPF
   <sub>6</sub> concentrations.
