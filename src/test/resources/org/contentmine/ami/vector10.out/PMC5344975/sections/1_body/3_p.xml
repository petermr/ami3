<p>In this regard, we believe that time-resolved nonlinear infrared spectroscopy is an ideal method capable of providing critical information on ultrafast chemical exchanges between different solvation structures

 <sup>+</sup> ion. Here considering the carbonyl stretching vibration of DEC as an infrared probe, we carried out Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), femtosecond infrared pump-probe and two-dimensional (2D) infrared studies of chemical exchange processes between DEC molecules with and without Coulombic interaction with Li
 <sup>+</sup>. One of the most difficult problems in the present linear and nonlinear infrared spectroscopic investigations is that the infrared probe, DEC, itself is the solvent too. Thus, with normal infrared cells with several micrometre thickness at best, the linear absorption is saturated and the nonlinear infrared signal fields are self-attenuated, which renders a difficulty in detecting weak 2D infrared signal. To overcome this, we prepared a home-built thin sample cell coated with SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, using radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique (see
