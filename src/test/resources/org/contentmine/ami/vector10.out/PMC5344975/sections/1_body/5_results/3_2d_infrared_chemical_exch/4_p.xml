<p>In this regard, the 2D infrared spectroscopy is an ideal tool for studying such ultrafast structural changes inside each solvation shell, because it is capable of tracking frequency changes of infrared probe (C=O stretch mode of DEC in the present case) induced by conformational transitions between different solvation structures. Indeed, at longer waiting time (

 <sub>w</sub>&gt;2 ps), one can clearly observe cross peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The positive cross peak on the upper-left corner results from the breaking of Li
 <sup>+</sup>···DEC, that is, transition from Li–DEC to free DEC, which reduces the number of DEC solvent molecules in the first solvation shell (the backward reaction in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Another positive cross peak appears on the lower-right corner, even though its magnitude is comparatively weak because of its destructive interference with the negative diagonal peak from free DEC. The positive and negative cross peaks in the lower-right corner represent the formation of Li–DEC complex or the increase of coordination number around Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion (the forward reaction in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).
