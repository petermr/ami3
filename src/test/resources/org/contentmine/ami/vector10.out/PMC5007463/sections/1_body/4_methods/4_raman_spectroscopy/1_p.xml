<p>A confocal Raman microscope (WITec Alpha 300) was used to obtain Raman spectra. A Nd:YAG 532 nm laser was used as the excitation source, with a holographic grating of 600 grooves/mm (BLZ 500 nm) and a 50 μm diameter pinhole. The laser power incident on the surface sample was kept low in order to avoid decomposition and damage of the formed graphene. The Raman spectrum in
