 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> depicts the experimental set-up. In an SFA experiment, a molecularly smooth contact between two opposing materials on crossed cylindrical silica disks is established. The opposing materials are designed in such a way that the two semitransparent opposing mirrors form an interferometer. Here a silver mirror is evaporated on the backside of a transparent mica surface, and the opposing surface is either: (1) also back-silvered mica (symmetric), (2) a gold mirror or (3) an iridium mirror covered with graphene. If white light is guided through such a contact, constructive and destructive interference generates so-called fringes of equal chromatic order (FECO), which can be detected using an imaging spectrometer. The flat part of the FECO indicated in
