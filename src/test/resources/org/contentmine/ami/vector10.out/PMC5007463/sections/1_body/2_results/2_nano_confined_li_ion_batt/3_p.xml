<p>In order to study further the mechanical properties of the confined electrolyte, the respective confined SFA disks were separated (
 <italic>D</italic>&gt;&gt;100 nm) after the initial wetting, allowing the electrolyte to fully penetrate into the contact volume for all interface materials. After a period of 2 min, the disks were brought into close contact again, pushing out most of the electrolyte within the contact. Interestingly, after full wetting of the contacts not all of the electrolyte can be pushed out from all contacts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows typical multiple approach-retraction (contact-separation) cycles, each marked by an arrow (S). With this simple procedure a more rigid nanoscaled electrolyte film remains on all surfaces, which cannot be squeezed out of the contact area with the pressures that can be reached in the SFA (∼100 bar)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This behaviour indicates that wetting of a confined pore proceeds via a completely different mechanism compared to wetting of a macroscopic surface. In particular, the liquid surface tension in confinement can be considerably different if wetting occurs via a confined pore. This is because of the fact that ions or other species may not necessarily diffuse into an established pore at the bulk concentration, establishing a confined liquid that may differ significantly from the bulk. In contrast, if a macroscopic surface is wet, the liquid surface tension remains at its bulk value and the bulk liquid establishes a macroscopic contact angle.
