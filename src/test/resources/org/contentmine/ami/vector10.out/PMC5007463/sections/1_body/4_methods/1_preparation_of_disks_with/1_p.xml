<p>The mica sheets that were used in the experiments were cleaved by hand, producing sheets with uniform thicknesses ranging from 2 to 5 μm and a surface area of typically 5–10 cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The outer edges of the sheets were melt-cut using a heated platinum wire. The mica sheets were back-silvered using PVD and cut into small pieces, which were subsequently glued with ultraviolet-curable glue (Norland Adhesives, NOA81) on cylindrical silica disks (nominal radius of curvature 
 <italic>R</italic>=2 cm). Atomically smooth gold films were prepared and deposited on SFA disks using a templating technique described elsewhere

 <sub>MS</sub>=0) was measured in dry argon between mica and the SFA spring disk (mica, gold or graphene).
