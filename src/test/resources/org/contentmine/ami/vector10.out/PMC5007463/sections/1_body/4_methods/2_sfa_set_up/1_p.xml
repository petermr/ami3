 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> shows a detailed schematic diagram of the SFA (SFA-2000, SurForce LLC) set-up used in this study. Two semi-transparent curved disks are placed in a crossed cylinder geometry in a nitrogen atmosphere inside an airtight steel box. The top disk is mechanically fixed. The bottom disk is attached to a spring and displacement mechanism, which allows us to move the opposing disks into a well-defined contact at a given force. The contact is flat because of the glue which is used to fix the mica sheet on the silica disk. During the experiment, white light is guided through these disks, both of which have a semi-transparent mirror: silver on the backside of mica, iridium below the graphene layer and gold on the disk where the metal itself serves as a semi-transparent mirror. When moved close together, these mirrors form an interferometer. The constructive and destructive interference of the white light at discrete wavelengths leads to the generation of the FECO, which are detected by guiding the interfered light into a grating spectrometer using a set of mirrors. A typical FECO is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, which clearly depicts the flat region of fringes, indicating an extended flat contact region. The FECO allows the determination of the intermirror distance with a nominal resolution of 10–30 pm, that is, well below 1 Å. At the same time, the lateral shape of the fringes represents an image of a segment of the contact area, having a lateral resolution of ∼1.0 μm. The flat round-shaped contact area of the mica–graphene set-up, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, has a diameter of 100 μm. During the initial contact situation in a dry argon atmosphere, the absolute zero distance (
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>MS</sub>=0) is defined. In the course of the experiment, FECO were recorded at two frames per second and continuously monitored. A change of the FECO fringe position (which is, in fact, a wavelength shift Δ
 <italic>λ</italic> away from the initial 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) can be correlated to a shift in distance, Δ
 <italic>D</italic>, of the opposing mirrors.
