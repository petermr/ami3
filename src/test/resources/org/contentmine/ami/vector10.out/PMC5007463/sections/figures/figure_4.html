 <caption> Effect of water on nano-confined lithium-ion battery electrolyte layers. ( a) Layer size evolution in mica–mica, mica–gold and mica–graphene opposing materials during water injection after electrolyte injection, and multiple contact-opening cycles. Water injections were performed on the mica–graphene contact with increased layer push-out (1&gt;2&gt;3). ( b) Detail of proposed confined electrolyte layering including mobile Li +(EC) x layers and schematic illustration of the Li-ion migration towards the water droplet. </caption>
