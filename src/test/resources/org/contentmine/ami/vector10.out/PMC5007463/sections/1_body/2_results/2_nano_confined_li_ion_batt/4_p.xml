<p>In the case of a mica–mica arrangement (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, green spheres), the layer size remains stable after the contact is restored and additional pressure is applied, indicating the presence of a rigid electrolyte film between the opposing surfaces. In contrast, in the mica–gold experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, red spheres) the distance slowly relaxes further after initially restoring the confined gap at 4.8 nm. The longer time needed to establish a stable rigid film at 4.0 nm indicates a slower relaxation of the volume of the initial film on the gold surface compared with mica. This more viscous film behaviour may be related to a homogenous film adapting to the confinement over time or near-surface layers, which are initially less ordered. In the mica–mica and mica–gold experiments, no deviation of the behaviour seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> was observed upon the application of additional force.
