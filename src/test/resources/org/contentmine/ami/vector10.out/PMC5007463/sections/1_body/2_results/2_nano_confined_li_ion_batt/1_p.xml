<p>In this work we established a dry initial contact, where opposing surfaces are separated by 
 <italic>D</italic>∼0 nm, and then we injected the electrolyte into the direct vicinity of (1) mica–graphene, (2) mica–gold and (3) mica–mica contacts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) while following the wetting behaviour of the confined interface in real time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> shows the initial change in distances just after injecting the electrolyte (1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethylene carbonate (DEC) 1:1 by volume), that is, the wetting behaviour of the investigated opposing materials for a nano-confined interface. As can be seen again in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, the distance between the two disks drops by 1.7–1.9 Å below the initially determined zero-point for all investigated contacts. A population mapping of the mirror shift is plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b–d</xref> for the three materials used for the lower disk, showing thickness changes during initial wetting. The initial change to negative ∼1.7–1.9 Å in distance can be explained by the extrusion of a monolayer of adsorbed water molecules. We performed our experiments at a relative humidity well below the ambient 40% in an experimental cell that was purged with dry Nitrogen, which leads to a partial monolayer of adsorbed water molecules

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Upon pressing two mica surfaces together, the partially covered mica surfaces form a monolayer of water. In contrast to aqueous solutions, where the first adsorbed water molecules are immobile because of the high negative surface charge
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, water is weakly bound and highly mobile at room temperature and low surface charging in the present situation. In addition, Li-ions have a higher affinity to water molecules than to EC/DEC organic solvents in the electrolyte
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Thus, in the confined geometry with two opposing surfaces in intimate contact, the weakly surface-bound water molecules are thus drawn out of the contact area into the available Li-containing organic electrolyte. Consequently, the two disks of the set-up will move closer together by one monolayer of water.
