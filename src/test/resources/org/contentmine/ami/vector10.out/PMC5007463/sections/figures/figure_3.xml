  <title>Nano-confined lithium-ion battery electrolyte layering.</title>
  <p>Layer size evolution for opposing materials: (
   <bold>a</bold>) mica–mica and mica–gold, and (
   <bold>d</bold>) mica–graphene. During the measurement, the electrolyte was injected, the surfaces were separated and brought back into contact (
   <sub>s</sub>), and the force on the spring disk was increased (+Δ
   <italic>F</italic>). Models of the layer formation in opposing materials: (
   <bold>b</bold>) mica–mica, (
   <bold>c</bold>) mica–gold and (
   <bold>e</bold>) mica–graphene.
