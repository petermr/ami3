 <caption> Nano-confined lithium-ion battery electrolyte layering. Layer size evolution for opposing materials: ( a) mica–mica and mica–gold, and ( d) mica–graphene. During the measurement, the electrolyte was injected, the surfaces were separated and brought back into contact ( s), and the force on the spring disk was increased (+Δ F). Models of the layer formation in opposing materials: ( b) mica–mica, ( c) mica–gold and ( e) mica–graphene. </caption>
