 <caption> Performance of 5 V-class LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4 electrode in a half-cell. Charge–discharge voltage curves of LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4|lithium metal half-cells using ( a) dilute 1:10.8, ( b) moderately concentrated 1:1.9 and ( c) superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolytes at a C/5 rate. Some/all curves of 1st, 2nd, 10th, 50th and 100th cycles are shown. ( d) Discharge (Li + intercalation) capacity retention of the half-cells using different concentrations of LiFSA/DMC electrolytes at a C/5 rate. ( e) Rate capacity and subsequent cycling retention of the half-cells using 1:1.3 LiFSA-based electrolytes with different carbonate solvents. Charge–discharge tests were conducted at 25 °C with a cutoff voltage of 3.5–4.9 V and a maximum-time restriction of 10 h except for that using the 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte whose cutoff voltage was 3.5–5.2 V. The 1C-rate corresponds to 147 mA g −1 on the weight basis of the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4 electrode. </caption>
