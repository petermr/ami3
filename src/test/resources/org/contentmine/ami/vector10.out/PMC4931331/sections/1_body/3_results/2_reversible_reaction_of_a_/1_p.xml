<p>Anodic dissolution of the Al current collector and/or oxidative decomposition of solvent may be encountered in the high-voltage application of amide-based electrolytes. To exclude the possible influence of the anodic Al dissolution, we initially used platinum foil as the current collector for the LiNi
