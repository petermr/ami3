<p>One major problem is metal dissolution from the positive electrode at high voltages, which poses a serious dilemma in designing an electrolyte. In state-of-the-art lithium-ion electrolyte, chemically unstable LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> is an essential component to suppress anodic (oxidative) dissolution of an aluminium current collector because its hydrolysis product of hydrofluoric acid (HF) contributes to an insoluble AlF
 <sub>3</sub> passivation film

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, the generated HF accelerates the dissolution of transition metals from the active electrode materials, which causes severe capacity decay upon cycling, especially at high voltages and elevated temperatures

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> but improvements are still unsatisfactory. Efforts have tried more stable salts (less tendency to generate HF) to replace LiPF

As a result, it remains a dilemma for electrolyte design to suppress both the Al dissolution (requiring an unstable salt) and transition metal dissolution (avoiding an unstable salt). Recently, increasing the concentration of amide salts was reported to alleviate anodic Al dissolution
