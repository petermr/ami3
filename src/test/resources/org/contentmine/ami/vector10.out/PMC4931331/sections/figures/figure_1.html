 <caption> Physicochemical properties dependent on solution concentration. ( a) Images of various salt-to-solvent molar ratios of LiFSA/DMC solutions. Viscosity ( b) and ionic conductivity ( c) for solutions of LiFSA in DMC, EC and EC:DMC (1:1 by mol.) at 30 °C. The X LiFSA mole fraction is the molar amount of LiFSA salt divided by the total molar amount of the salt and solvents. The LiFSA-to-solvent molar ratios of the solutions are shown on the upper axis. ( d) Flame tests of a commercial dilute electrolyte of 1.0 mol dm −3 LiPF 6/EC:DMC (1:1 by vol.) and ( e) the lab-made superconcentrated electrolyte of 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC. </caption>
