 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> for example). Especially, the electrolytes using low-dielectric-constant and low-viscosity linear carbonate solvents (for example, DMC, EMC and DEC) showed a faster rate capability as compared with those using high-dielectric-constant and high-viscosity cyclic carbonate solvents (for example, EC, PC and their corresponding mixtures), which is at least partly owing to the much higher ionic conductivity of the former. These results demonstrate that the salt-superconcentrated strategy is a simple, effective and fruitful approach to various safe and stable high-voltage electrolytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that stable and fast charge/discharge cycling of a 5 V-class electrode using amide salt-based organic electrolytes has been achieved.
