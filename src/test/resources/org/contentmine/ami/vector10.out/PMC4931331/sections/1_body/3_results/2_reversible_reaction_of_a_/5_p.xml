<p>We now study the solution structure of the electrolytes using Raman spectroscopy observation and density functional theory molecular dynamics simulation (DFT-MD). As shown in the Raman spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> left), a free DMC molecule exhibits an O-CH
 <sub>3</sub> stretching vibration band at 910 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This band shifts up to 930–935 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> when DMC participates in Li
 <sup>+</sup> solvation. In dilute 1:10.8 LiFSA/DMC, the majority of DMC molecules exist in a free state because the solvent-to-salt molar ratio (10.8) is much larger than a typical four- or fivefold coordination of Li
 <sup>+</sup> in aprotic solvents. As the LiFSA concentration increases, the population of free DMC decreases and that of Li
 <sup>+</sup>-coordinated DMC increases; the Li
 <sup>+</sup>-FSA
 <sup>−</sup> association simultaneously intensifies through the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs, FSA
 <sup>−</sup> coordinating to one Li
 <sup>+</sup>) and aggregate clusters (AGGs, FSA
 <sup>−</sup> coordinating to two or more Li
 <sup>+</sup>). The latter is evidenced from a remarkable upshift of the FSA
 <sup>−</sup> band (700–780 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> right), which is typically observed in the amide-based concentrated solutions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. For the moderately concentrated 1:2 LiFSA/DMC solution, the Raman band corresponding to free DMC is remarkably weakened, suggesting that the majority of DMC are solvating to Li
 <sup>+</sup>. This is consistent with the DFT-MD simulation, which shows ca. 90% DMC are coordinating to Li
 <sup>+</sup> with the rest as free solvent (marked as light blue in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, the simulation illustrates that all FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anions are coordinating to Li
 <sup>+</sup> with ca. 20% as CIPs and ca. 80% as AGGs (marked as orange and dark blue in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, respectively). The coordination environment is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>. For the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC solution, both DMC and FSA
 <sup>−</sup> bands further upshift substantially, indicating both Li
 <sup>+</sup>-DMC and Li
 <sup>+</sup>-FSA
 <sup>−</sup> interactions enhanced compared with those in 1:2 LiFSA/DMC. The DFT-MD simulation reveals that all DMC molecules, together with all FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anions, are coordinating to Li
 <sup>+</sup> (no free solvent or anion). Interestingly, besides oxygen, significant amount of nitrogen on FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anions also participate in the coordination with Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which is hardly observed at the lower concentrations. The contribution of nitrogen coordinating to Li
 <sup>+</sup> is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. More importantly, almost all FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anions remain in AGG states during the whole DFT-MD simulation time (0.1 fs × 100,000 steps), and a CIP state is rarely observed, demonstrating the unusual solution structural feature with AGG clusters as the predominant components in the superconcentrated LiFSA/DMC solution. It is noteworthy that each FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anion coordinates to 2–3 Li
 <sup>+</sup> and each Li
 <sup>+</sup> is coordinated by 2–3 FSA
 <sup>−</sup> in 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC. Hence, FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anions in the superconcentrated solution connect with each other through the intensive association with Li
 <sup>+</sup>, leading to a reinforced three-dimensional network (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This feature is different from the less concentrated solutions, wherein significant amount of CIPs and free solvents divide the solution structure into relatively small-size parts.
