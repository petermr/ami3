A combined separator, composed of cellulose separator (Nippon Kodoshi, placed on the positive electrode side) and glass fibre separator (Advantec GB-50, placed on the negative electrode side), was used. The amount of electrolyte in a coin cell was ca 160 μl to fully wet the separators and electrodes. In the full cells, the weight ratio of LiNi

Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and rate capability tests were conducted on a charge/discharge unit (TOSCAT). Charge and discharge were conducted at the same C-rate without using a constant-voltage mode at both ends of the charge and discharge.
