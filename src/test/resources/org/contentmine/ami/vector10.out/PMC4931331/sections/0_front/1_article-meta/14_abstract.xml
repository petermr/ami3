 <p>Finding a viable electrolyte for next-generation 5 V-class lithium-ion batteries is of primary importance. A long-standing obstacle has been metal-ion dissolution at high voltages. The LiPF
  <sub>6</sub> salt in conventional electrolytes is chemically unstable, which accelerates transition metal dissolution of the electrode material, yet beneficially suppresses oxidative dissolution of the aluminium current collector; replacing LiPF
  <sub>6</sub> with more stable lithium salts may diminish transition metal dissolution but unfortunately encounters severe aluminium oxidation. Here we report an electrolyte design that can solve this dilemma. By mixing a stable lithium salt LiN(SO
  <sub>2</sub>F)
  <sub>2</sub> with dimethyl carbonate solvent at extremely high concentrations, we obtain an unusual liquid showing a three-dimensional network of anions and solvent molecules that coordinate strongly to Li
  <sup>+</sup> ions. This simple formulation of superconcentrated LiN(SO
  <sub>2</sub>F)
  <sub>2</sub>/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte inhibits the dissolution of both aluminium and transition metal at around 5 V, and realizes a high-voltage LiNi
  <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
  <sub>1.5</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>/graphite battery that exhibits excellent cycling durability, high rate capability and enhanced safety.
