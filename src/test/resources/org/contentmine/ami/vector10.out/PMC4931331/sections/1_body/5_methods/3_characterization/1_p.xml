<p>The density and viscosity of solution samples were evaluated with a DMA 35 density meter and a Lovis 2000 M viscometer, respectively. The ionic conductivity was measured by AC impedance spectroscopy at 1 kHz (Solartron 147055BEC) in a symmetric cell (Pt|electrolyte|Pt). The flammability was tested on an electrolyte-soaked glass fibre filter (Advantec GB-100).</p>
