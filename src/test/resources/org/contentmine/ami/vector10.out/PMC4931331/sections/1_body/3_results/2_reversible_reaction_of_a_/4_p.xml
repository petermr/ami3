<p>The progressive inhibition of anodic Al dissolution with increasing salt concentration is further proved by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of an Al electrode and the subsequent scanning electron microscopy observation on the polarized Al surface (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> for details). This notable concentration effect was recently reported but with a debate on whether a stable surface film on Al (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) or the elimination of uncoordinated (free) solvents of electrolyte
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> plays the key role. We conducted a surface analysis of the Al electrodes polarized in various concentrations of LiFSA/DMC electrolytes by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) as well as a comparative LSV study between fresh and polarized Al electrodes (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref> for details). We were unable to obtain any essential evidence to support the existence of a stronger surface film generated in the concentrated electrolyte. Instead, we found that the LiFSA salt readily decomposes and produces LiF upon Ar
 <sup>+</sup> etching (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The previous observation in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>—a much thicker surface film of LiF produced in a higher concentration of electrolyte—is likely to arise from the decomposition of un-rinsed amide salt induced by Ar
 <sup>+</sup> etching in the XPS measurement.
