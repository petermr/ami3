<p>LiFSA (Nippon shokubai) and all solvents (DMC, DEC, EMC, EC and PC, Kishida Chemical Co. Ltd) were lithium battery grade and used without purification. Electrolyte solutions were prepared by mixing a given amount of LiFSA with solvents in an Ar-filled glove box. The commercial electrolyte of 1.0 mol dm
 <sup>−3</sup> LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>/EC:DMC (1:1 by vol) was purchased from Kishida Chemical Co. Ltd and used as the reference. Both the lab-made LiFSA-based electrolytes and as-received commercial LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>-based electrolyte were dried by molecular sieve before tests. The water content was less than 2 p.p.m., as detected by a coulometric Karl Fischer Titrator.
