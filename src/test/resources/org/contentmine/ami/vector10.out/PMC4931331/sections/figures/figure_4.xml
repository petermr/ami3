  <title>Li salt−solvent coordination structure dependent on salt concentration.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) The several main species in the LiFSA/DMC solutions. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Raman spectra of LiFSA/DMC solutions with various salt-to-solvent molar ratios in the range of 890–900 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> (O-CH
   <sub>3</sub> stretching mode of the DMC solvent) and 700–780 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> (S-N stretching mode of the FSA
   <sup>−</sup> anion). Snapshots of typical equilibrium trajectories obtained by DFT-MD simulations: (
   <bold>c</bold>) dilute solution (1 LiFSA/25 DMC, &lt;1 mol dm
   <sup>−3</sup>), (
   <bold>d</bold>) moderately concentrated solution (12 LiFSA/24 DMC, ca. 4 mol dm
   <sup>−3</sup>), and (
   <bold>e</bold>) superconcentrated solution (10 LiFSA/11 DMC, ca. 5.5 mol dm
   <sup>−3</sup>). The coordination of Li
   <sup>+</sup>−DMC and Li
   <sup>+</sup>−FSA
   <sup>−</sup> is supposed to build up when the involved atoms locate within 2.5 Å from Li
   <sup>+</sup>. The coordination numbers of solvents and anions to Li
   <sup>+</sup> are shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>. Li cations are marked in purple. Free and coordinated DMC molecules are marked in light blue and grey, respectively. Free, CIP and AGG states of FSA
   <sup>−</sup> anions are marked in red, orange and dark blue, respectively. Hydrogen atoms are not shown.
