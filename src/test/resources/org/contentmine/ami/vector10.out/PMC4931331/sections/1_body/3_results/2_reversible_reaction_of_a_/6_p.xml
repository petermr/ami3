<p>Generally, the anodic metal dissolution requires three steps: first, oxidation of the metal to a metal cation; second, coordination of the metal cation by solvents or anions; and finally, the diffusion of the solvated metal cation to the bulk electrolyte
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. At high voltages of ∼5 V, the first step proceeds more rapidly and extensively than at the conventional operating voltage of 4 V. Thereby, the subsequent coordination and diffusion must be strongly inhibited by the nature of electrolyte solutions to suppress the metal ion dissolution. In the moderately concentrated 1:2 LiFSA/carbonate electrolytes, the presence of significant free solvents and CIPs (with two or more coordination sites remaining vacant) could coordinate to Al cations and fail to inhibit Al dissolution completely at 5 V. In contrast, the superconcentrated 1:1.1 LiFSA/DMC electrolyte effectively inhibits Al dissolution even over 5 V, which can be ascribed to its peculiar AGGs-predominant solution structure: (i) all DMC solvents and all FSA
 <sup>−</sup> anions strongly coordinate to Li
 <sup>+</sup> cations and thus have a much lower probability of coordinating to other metal cations; (ii) the resulting reinforced three-dimensional network further retards the diffusion rate of the metal cations, particularly, those with multiple charge.
