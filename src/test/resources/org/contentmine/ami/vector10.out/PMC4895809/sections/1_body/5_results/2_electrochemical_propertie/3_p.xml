<p>We also analysed the effect of the deposited thickness of the CN

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7a</xref> shows the cycle performance of all CCNEs with different deposition times from 5 to 50 min. The reversible capacity gradually improves as the deposition time increases until 30 min. However, the capacity slightly decreases when the time increases to 40−50 min, which reveals an optimal thickness of the CN

 </sub> shell depositing on the CuO core. The longer time introduces a thicker CN
