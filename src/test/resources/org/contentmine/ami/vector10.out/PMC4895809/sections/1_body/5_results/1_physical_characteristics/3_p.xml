<p>The core–shell nanostructures in CCNEs are investigated by TEM. It can be observed from the s.e.m. image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) that the nanostructure array exhibits clear core–shell structures. Therefore, the wire-like nanostructure is considered to be a nanocable. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b–g</xref>, TEM images reveal that the nanocables have inner cores with diameters of 50−100 nm, and outer shells with diameters of 15−140 nm. In general, the diameter of the CuO cores is determined by the oxidation temperature and time, and the thickness of the CN

 </sub> shells is mainly controlled by adjusting the deposition time. The element distribution in the nanocables is analysed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, the EDX elemental mapping of the nanocable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) shows an intense signal for Cu and O in the middle and a uniform distribution of C and N across the shell, suggesting a uniform coverage of the CN

 </sub> film over the CuO core. The crystal structure of the nanocables is observed in the high-resolution TEM of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>. It is obvious that a wire-like CuO core is covered by a nanosized microporous carbon-nitride shell, and the middle of the CuO core is clearly divided by a (111) twin plane along the longitudinal axis, which has been reported in CuO nanowires synthesized via heating copper substrates in air by Jiang 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h,i</xref>, note that each side of the CuO core is, indeed, a single crystal with well-defined fringe space pattern. The interplanar spacing for each side is 2.32 and 2.52 Å, which correspond well to the (111) and (−111) spacings in monoclinic CuO, respectively

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This finding is also in good agreement with the first-principle calculations that (111) and (−111) planes have the lowest surface energies under ambient conditions and, hence, should be the most preferential facets of CuO nanowires
