<p>We investigated the effect of the different substrates on the cell performance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a,b</xref> show a set of parallel charge–discharge profiles and capacity retention over 200 cycles for comparison, respectively. The initial discharge capacity of the CCNE based on the foil, grid and net is 1134.1, 1164.8 and 1190.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. After 200 cycles, their remainder capacity is 610.9, 669.0 and 717.7 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The CCNEs based on the grid and net deliver higher reversible discharge capacities and coulombic efficiency than those of the foil. This difference is due to the larger specific surface area and more abundant transfer paths in the grid and net substrates, which provide extra space for diffusion of the electrolyte and accommodation of the strain induced by the volume change during the electrochemical reaction, thus leading to higher charge transfer efficiency and better structural stability

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6c</xref> shows the rate cycling performance of these cells. The capacity and rate performance are also gradually improved as the specific surface area increases. The net sample shows the highest capacity, 589.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, at the current density of 2500, mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. These results indicate that the morphologies of the nanosubstrates have a significant effect on the cell performance.
