<p>In conclusion, we have developed battery electrodes combining a flexible design and 3D hierarchical nanostructures. The specific combination of composition and conformation addresses stability challenges common to many conversion electrodes and may be generalized to related systems. In addition, the simple fabrication process involving mature sputtering technology boosts prospects for scaleable production.</p>
