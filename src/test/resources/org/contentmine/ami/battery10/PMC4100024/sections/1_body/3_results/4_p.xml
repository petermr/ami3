 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. The transition metal L-edge EELS measures the dipole allowed transitions from metal 2

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Although the exact nature of the hole states (e.g., location) depend on the degree of covalency in the TMO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedral unit, it is generally agreed that, in the (Ni, Mn, Co)-O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedral unit, the intensity of the pre-edge of the O K-edge is in a positive relationship with the formal oxidation states of (Ni, Mn, Co) due to the sharing of hole states in the TMO
 <sub>6</sub> unit
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. A continuous data acquisition mode was used to collect EELS spectra on a selected region shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>. As the acquisition proceeded, the electron beam gradually damaged the NMC particle. There was an incubation period from 0–40 s in the integrated pre-edge intensity before it dropped dramatically at 50 s, indicating that an accumulation of lattice interruptions by electron beam was necessary to initiate the removal of lithium and oxygen. TM L-edge EELS investigation provided more direct evidence for the changes in the oxidation states of transition metals, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4d–h</xref>. The formal oxidation states of Ni, Mn and Co in the pristine NMC structure are +2, +4 and +3, respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The most salient features of the TM L-edge spectra can be captured by the peak positions of TM-L
 <sub>3</sub> edges. As the acquisition proceeds (from the bottom to the top in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4d, 4e, 4g and 4h</xref>), there are noticeable peak shifts towards lower energy for Mn-L
 <sub>3</sub> and Co-L
 <sub>3</sub> edges, indicating that Mn and Co were both gradually reduced. As expected, Ni remained in the +2 oxidation state in the
