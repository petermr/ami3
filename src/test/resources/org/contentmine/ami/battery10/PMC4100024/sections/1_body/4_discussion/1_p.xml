<p>We have shown that electron beam damage is a common phenomenon affecting battery materials studied by TEM. For example, the Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> component in the SRL of a lithiated NiO nanosheet rapidly decomposed during EELS data acquisition. NMC cathode materials also degraded at low scan rates or with intensive doses. Li K-edge EELS energy onset is buried between the M-edges of transition metals in NMC cathode materials, while transition metal oxidation states are also prone to change. These intrinsic characteristics make the direct evidence of lithium removal unlikely using Li K-edge EELS during irradiation. Nevertheless, during electron beam irradiation, the formal oxidation states of Mn and Co were reduced from +4 to +2 and from +3 to +2, respectively. Therefore, correlating the present

The present study suggests that, under some circumstances, the lattice reconstruction induced by electron beams can be used as a model system to study structural dynamics in electrochemical processes. Finally, special caution is recommended in studying battery materials to avoid indiscriminate sample degradation. This can be achieved by increasing the irradiation area and the scan rate.
