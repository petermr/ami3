 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In order to achieve reliable battery packs for these applications, various thrusts of research and development must be conducted simultaneously, including but not limited to the design of advanced battery materials, cell configuration, circuit optimization, and diagnostics. With respect to the chemistries of electrode materials, various analytical diagnostic tools have been performed to probe chemical and structural environments from the bulk to the surface
