 <caption> BF-STEM observation of an / / composite particle under electron beam with a 4× faster frame rate (300 keV, ~36 pA, 512 × 512 pixels, pixel size 0.306 angstrom, pixel dwell time 6 us, frame rate 1.89 sec/frame). (a) BF-STEM image of a particle edge region with similar thickness and crystal orientation relative to that of Figure 2a. (b) FFT pattern of the composite particle before electron beam damage, where the rock-salt, spinel and layered structures are observed in the pattern. Note that the phase is an intermediate during the transition in electrochemical cycles 5 21. (c) FFT pattern of the composite particle after electron beam damage, which corresponds to the 200 th frame (6 min 18 s) in the series. The corresponding BF-STEM movie is provided in the supplemental information (Movie S3). F, R and S represent the , and phases in the FFT indices, respectively. </caption>
