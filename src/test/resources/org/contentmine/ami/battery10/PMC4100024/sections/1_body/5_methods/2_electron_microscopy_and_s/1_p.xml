<p>For electron microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, the electrode particles were scratched off and deposited onto TEM grids after the desired number of electrochemical cycles. A 200 keV and a 300 keV field-emission (scanning) transmission electron microscope (S/TEM) were used for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> imaging and spectroscopic studies. The 200 keV microscope was operated with an imaging condition of 11 mrad, 12 pA. The 300 keV instrument was operated with 17 mrad, 36 pA. Electron energy loss spectroscopy data sets were acquired using Gatan Tridiem spectrometers.
