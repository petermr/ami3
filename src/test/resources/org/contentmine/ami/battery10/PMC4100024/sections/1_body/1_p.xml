<p>The chemical environment at the particle surface determines the way an active electrode interacts with its surrounding electrolyte and impacts the resulting cycling behaviors. Surface modifications, such as artificial solid-electrode interphases, were reported to improve cycling performance

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. On the other hand, electrochemistry-induced surface reaction layers (SRLs), such as solid-electrolyte interphases at anode material particle surfaces, also play critical roles in determining the way electrode materials interact with electrolytic solutions and how lithium ions intercalate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. SRLs are generally composed of oligomers and inorganic compounds that are formed from the electrochemical reduction of solvent and electrolytic salt
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Similar to the behavior of many organic compounds under electron beams, SRLs are prone to beam damage. Structural changes may also occur as a result of charge-discharge cycling, and have been proven to impact battery performance. For example, in LiNi

Lithium-containing compounds (e.g., electrode materials, SRLs) are easily degraded under electron beams due to the knock-on effect (i.e., atomic displacements by electron-nuclear collisions)
