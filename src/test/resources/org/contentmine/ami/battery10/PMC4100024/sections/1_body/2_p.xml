<p>The present work was designed to understand the effect of electron beam damage on surface reaction layers and NMC materials during data acquisition using TEM. It is shown that the chemistry and structure can be severely altered under certain circumstances, such as low scan rates. The degradation processes resemble the lattice reconstruction and chemical evolution that are caused by charge-discharge cycling
