    <div class="fig" id="PMC4100024/figure_2"> Bright-field STEM (BF-STEM) observation of an NMC-based composite particle under electron beam irradiation (300 keV, ~36 pA, 1024 × 1024 pixels, pixel size 0.153 angstrom, pixel dwell time 6 us, frame time 7.55 sec/frame). (a) BF-STEM image of an NMC particle coated with rock-salt ( ) structure at the surface. (b) The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the BF-STEM image in (a), where the zone axes for the and phases are [ ] and [100], respectively. (c) FFT results for a series of BF-STEM images under electron beam irradiation, where the FFT results correspond to pristine (0 s), 1 st frame (7.55 s), 10 th frame (1 min 15.5 s), 20 th frame (2 min 31 s), 30 th frame (3 min 46.6 s), 50 th frame (6 min 17.5 s), 60 th frame (7 min 33 s), 70 th frame (8 min 48.5 s), 80 th frame (10 min 4 s), 90 th frame (11 min 19.5 s), 100 th frame (12 min 35 s) and 110 th frame (13 min 50.5 s) in the series. The intensity of the diffraction spots for the phase decreased during exposure to the electron beam. F and R represent the and phases in the FFT indices, respectively. The corresponding BF-STEM and FFT movies are provided in Movie S1 and Movie S2 in the supplemental information, respectively.
