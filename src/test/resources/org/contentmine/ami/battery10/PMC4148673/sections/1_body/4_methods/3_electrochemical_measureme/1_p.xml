<p>The capacities and cycle properties of the powders were determined using a 2032-type coin cell. The electrode was prepared from a mixture comprising 70 wt% active material, 20 wt% activated carbon (Super P), and a 10 wt% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder. Lithium metal and a microporous polypropylene film were used as the counter electrode and separator, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in a 1:1 mixture (by volume) of ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate (EC–DMC) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate. Charge and discharge characteristics were determined by cycling from 0.01 to 3 V over a wide range of current densities. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>.
