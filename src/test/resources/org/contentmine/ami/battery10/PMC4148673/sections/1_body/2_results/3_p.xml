 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2</xref> shows the XRD patterns of the post-treated ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders. The post-treated powders had a pure ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> phase with no impurity phases irrespective of dextrin additive. Phase separation of each metal component could have occurred during the post-treatment process for the yolk–shell powders or during the spray-drying process for the precursor powders. However, phase separation of the zinc and iron components did not occur in the preparation process of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders. Therefore, phase-pure ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders were prepared even at a low post-treatment temperature of 350°C. The morphologies of the powders prepared from the spray solution with dextrin and post-treated at 200°C are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3</xref>. The powders post-treated at 200°C within an alumina boat were divided into two regions, one dark brown and the other black as shown by photograph in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3</xref>. The precursor powders directly prepared by the spray-drying process and the phase-pure ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders were yellow and dark brown, respectively. The SEM images in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figures S4a and S4b</xref> show the morphologies of the black and dark brown powders, respectively. The dark brown powder had a yolk–shell structure, whereas the black powder had a filled structure. The carbonization of dextrin produced black Zn–Fe–C composite powders as an intermediate product during the post-treatment process. The repeated combustion and contraction processes of the Zn–Fe–C composite intermediate product formed during the post-treatment process produced the dark brown ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders.
