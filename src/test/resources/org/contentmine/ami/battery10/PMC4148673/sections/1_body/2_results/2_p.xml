 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows the morphologies of the post-treated ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders. The ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders prepared without dextrin had similar morphology before and after post-treatment at 450°C, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>. The pockmarked, spherical shape of the precursor powders without dextrin was maintained even after decomposition of the zinc and iron salts to form the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powder. On the other hand, the morphology of the powders prepared with dextrin changed after post-treatment at temperatures above 350°C. The filled structure of the precursor powders changed into a yolk–shell structure with a core/void/shell configuration after post-treatment, as shown in the SEM and TEM images in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2b–f</xref>. The TEM images of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders post-treated at 450°C clearly show a minimum of two shells in each particle. The elemental mapping images of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders post-treated at 450°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2g</xref>) show the uniform distribution of Zn and Fe components all over the powder. The BET surface areas of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with yolk-shell and filled structures post-treated at 450°C were 21.7 and 3.3 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
