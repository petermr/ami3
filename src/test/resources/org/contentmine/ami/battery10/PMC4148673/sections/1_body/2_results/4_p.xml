<p>The electrochemical properties of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders were compared with those of the powders with filled structure, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>. The ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders had similar initial discharge and charge curves at a current density of 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, irrespective of post-treatment temperature. Obvious voltage plateaus, including a short one at 1.0 V and a long one at 0.75 V, were observed in the initial discharge curves. The short voltage plateau at approximately 1.0 V can be attributed to the formation of Li

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled structure had only a long plateau at 0.67 V. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders post-treated at 450°C were 1226 and 909 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and the corresponding initial Coulombic efficiency was 74%. On the other hand, the initial discharge and charge capacities of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled morphology post-treated at 450°C were low as 993 and 580 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and the corresponding initial Coulombic efficiency was 58%. The irreversible capacity losses for the initial cycles, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref>, were mainly due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface caused by the reduction of the electrolyte

 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled structure. The ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders post-treated at a low temperature of 350°C also had a low initial Coulombic efficiency of 61% due to structural instability during cycling.
