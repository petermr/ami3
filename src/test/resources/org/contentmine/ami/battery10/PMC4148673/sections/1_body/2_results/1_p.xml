<p>The morphologies of the powders prepared directly by the spray-drying process from spray solutions with and without dextrin are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. The dried powder particles exhibited a spherical shape and no aggregation regardless of drying additive because of the good drying characteristics of zinc and iron salts under high humidity conditions. However, the use of dextrin as both a drying additive and a carbon source material improved the smoothness of the surface of the precursor powders. The concentration gradient within the droplets due to fast drying produced precursor powders with a distorted spherical shape, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1</xref> shows the thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the powders prepared from the spray solution with dextrin before and after post-treatment at 450°C. The precursor powders exhibited a distinct three-step weight loss below 400°C as a result of the decomposition of the metal salts and dextrin. The total weight loss of the precursor powders was 76 wt%. On the other hand, there was no observed weight loss in the powders post-treated at 450°C below 800°C.
