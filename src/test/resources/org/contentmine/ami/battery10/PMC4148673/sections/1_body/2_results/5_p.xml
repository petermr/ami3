 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref> shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders post-treated at 450°C for the first three cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Upon the initial cathodic reaction, in which the voltage slope ranged from 1.5 to 0.8 V, the ZnFe

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The broad reduction peak at 0.55 V in the first cycle could be ascribed to the reduction of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>0</sup> and Zn
 <sup>0</sup>, respectively, as well as the formation of Li–Zn alloys and Li

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In the subsequent cycles, one broad reduction peak, located at 0.9 V, was observed, which corresponds to the reversible reduction reaction of amorphous Fe

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. During the anodic process, two oxidation peaks are observed at 1.55 V and 1.8 V, which are associated with the oxidation of Zn
 <sup>0</sup> and Fe
 <sup>0</sup> to Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, respectively

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. From the second cycle onward, the cathodic and anodic peaks in the CV tests overlapped substantially, indicating that the electrode of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders showed outstanding cycle ability for the insertion and extraction of Li ions.
