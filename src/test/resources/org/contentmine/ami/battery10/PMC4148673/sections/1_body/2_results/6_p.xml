 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref> shows the cycling performances of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders at a current density of 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk-shell powders post-treated at 400 and 450°C had high discharge capacities of 800 and 862 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 200 cycles. On the other hand, the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled structure post-treated at 450°C and the yolk–shell powders post-treated at 350°C had low discharge capacities of 332 and 484 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 200 cycles, respectively, due to structural instability during cycling at a high current density. During cycling, the discharge capacities of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders post-treated at 400 and 450°C increased gradually after 60
 <sup>th</sup> cycles, primarily owing to the formation of a polymeric gel-like film on the active materials

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The polymeric gel-like film was also formed on the high BET surface area of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders post-treated 350°C. However, the increase in the discharge capacity as a result of the formation of a polymeric gel-like film on the active material was diminished by the decreased capacity due to the structural destroy of the yolk–shell powders post-treated at 350°C.
