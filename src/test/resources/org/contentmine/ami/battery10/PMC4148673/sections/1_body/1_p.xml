<p>In this manuscript, a large-scale production method of fabricating binary transition-metal oxide yolk–shell powders by applying a simple spray-drying process is proposed. In the spray-drying process, decomposition of metal salts does not occur because of the low operating temperature. Therefore, the spray-drying process is quite different from the spray pyrolysis process previously used to prepare yolk–shell powders of various compositions. However, one-pot preparation of yolk–shell powders cannot be achieved in a spray-drying process. Carbon is an inevitable requirement for the fabrication of yolk–shell powders using either the spray-drying process or the spray pyrolysis process. The key issue in spray drying is the need to prepare low-hygroscopicity precursor powders with a dense structure and spherical shape by applying an appropriate carbon source material. The carbon source material thus plays a key role in the preparation of yolk–shell-structured materials using the spray-drying process. Nanostructured zinc ferrite (ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) powders with various morphologies have been well studied as anode materials for LIBs

 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders have not been reported. In this study, dextrin was applied as both a carbon source material and drying agent for the large-scale production of ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders. The combustion of the precursor powders obtained by spray drying produced a yolk–shell-structured ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powder with good electrochemical properties.
