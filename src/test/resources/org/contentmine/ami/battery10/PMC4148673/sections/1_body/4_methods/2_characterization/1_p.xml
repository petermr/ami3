<p>The crystal structures of the post-treated powders were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'pert PRO MPD) using Cu Kαradiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu). The morphological characteristics were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6060) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) at 200 kV. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the powders were measured using N
 <sub>2</sub> gas as an adsorbate. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600) was performed in air at a heating rate of 10°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to determine the decomposition characteristics of the precursor powders obtained by the spray-drying process.
