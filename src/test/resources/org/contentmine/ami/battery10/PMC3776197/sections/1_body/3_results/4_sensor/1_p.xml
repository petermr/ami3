<p>The MnO@C nanocomposite, due to its open mesopores for fast transport of molecules and enhanced electron transfer through the carbon matrix towards substrates, offers not only high electrochemical energy storage capacities, but also can serve as a sensitive platform for detection of chemical or biological species that indicate specific cellular process

 <sub>2</sub> is one of the most important small molecule targets that are related to many cell functions
