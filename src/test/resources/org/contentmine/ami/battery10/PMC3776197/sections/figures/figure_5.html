 <caption> Sensing and cellular measurement of MnO@C nanocomposite on Ti foil. (a) Cyclic voltammograms in (i) 0, (ii) 0.4, and (iii) 2 mM of H 2O 2 in PBS solution. (b) Current-versus-time plot with repeated addition of 200 μM of H 2O 2 for directly growth (red curve) and post-coating (black curve) of MnO@C nanocomposite on Ti foil. (c) Concentration dependence plot of current change at different H 2O 2 concentrations. Inset: linear fitting for concentration range of 2 μM–2.4 mM. (d) Cellular assay of H 2O 2 detection for 293T cells and HeLa cells. Three conditions are presented for each cell lines: buffer without PMA or catalase (grey bars), buffer with PMA only (red bars), and buffer with both PMA and catalase (blue bars). </caption>
