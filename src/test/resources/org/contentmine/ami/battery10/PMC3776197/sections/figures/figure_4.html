 <caption> Supercapacitor measurement of MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foam. (a) Cyclic voltammograms at different scan rate of 25–500 mV s −1. (b) Charge-discharge curves at different current densities. (c) Specific capacitance dependence on the current density from 0.5–40 A g −1. (d) Repeated charge-discharge curves and (e) capacity retention of 2500 cycles at 1 A g −1. Inset: the charge-discharge curves of the 50 th, 1000 th and 2000 th cycles. (f) Capacity retention during repeated folding with an angle of almost 180° for 70 times. Inset: optical photos of the folded and extended electrodes of MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foam. </caption>
