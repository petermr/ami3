<p>Stimulated by the above concerns, we envision building up an integrated smart architecture, in which structural features and electroactivities of each component are fully manifested, the interface/chemical distributions are homogeneous at a nanoscale and a fast ion and electron transfer is guaranteed. Herein, we propose and realize a facile, effective, and general strategy for preparing MOs/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures by advantageously combining the electrospinning technique with the hydrothermal method, which holds many favorable merits including: (1) both the electrospinning and hydrothermal method have been proven to be a comparatively versatile, low cost, applicable and environmentally friendly technique. (2) This strategy can be extended to the fabrication of various hierarchical MOs, such as Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, CuO, on TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers to form MOs/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures. (3) The synergistic effects of nanobuilding blocks as well as the unique hierarchical heterostructures may contribute to the improved LIBs performance. With this design, not only all the desired functions of each constituent are effectively utilized, but also a strong synergistic effect can be realized. As MOs feature both high capacity and higher electronic conductivity (compared to TiO
 <sub>2</sub>), hierarchical heterostructures composed of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofiber and various metal oxides (MOs) could simultaneously increase the rate capability and specific capacity of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and improve the cycling performance of MOs by the synergistic effect. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the application of such hierarchical heterostructures, the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures are tested as LIBs anode for the first time, which show high reversible capacity, improved cycling stability, and excellent rate capability with respect to the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub>.
