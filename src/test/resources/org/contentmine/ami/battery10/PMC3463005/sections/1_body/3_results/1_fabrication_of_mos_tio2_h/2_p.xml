<p>To investigate the crystal phase of the samples, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>). The XRD patterns reveal that all the diffraction peaks could be indexed to anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No. 21–1272) and face-centered cubic phase of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (space group: 
 <italic>Fd3m</italic> (227), JCPDS No. 43-1003). These results confirm that the synthesis strategy adopted successfully achieves Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures integrating the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets and TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. Subsequently, the purity, composition and fine structure of the samples are further investigated. In XPS spectra, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. S2</xref> shows the characteristic peaks of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Co 2p, respectively, indicating the existence of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and cobalt elements in the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures. The C 1s and N 1s peaks may be assigned to the pyrolysis of the urea. Obviously, the Ti signal is absent from this XPS spectra. As XPS is a highly surface-specific technique with a typical analysis depth of ∼10 nm (lower than the thickness of the secondary Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> shell), it is reasonable that TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is not detected
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. This thus provides indirect experimental proof of the uniformity of the secondary Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanostructures coating the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. In Raman spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>), four well-resolved peaks are observed around 143.6 (E
 <sub>g</sub>), 399.1 (B
 <sub>1g</sub>), 519.3 (A
 <sub>1g</sub>), and 639.7 (E
 <sub>g</sub>) cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to the characteristic Raman modes of anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. After the growth of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets, in addition to the peaks from anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, the new peaks at 193.6 (B
 <sub>1g</sub>), 476.9 (E
 <sub>g</sub>), 517.1 (F
 <sub>2g</sub>), 615.1 (F
 <sub>2g</sub>), 684.3 (A
 <sub>1g</sub>) cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to the characteristic Raman modes of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, are observed and demonstrate the successful introduction of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. These results demonstrate the existence of both anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> in the heterostructures.
