<p>The electrodes were prepared by mixing active materials (70 wt%), acetylene black (20 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). After the above slurries were uniformly spread onto a copper foil, the electrodes were dried at 80°C in vacuum for 6 h. Then the electrodes were pressed and cut into disks before transferring into an Argon-filled glove box. Coin cells (CR2025) were laboratory-assembled using lithium metal as the counter electrode, Celgard 2400 membrane as the separator and LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC, 1:1 vol%) as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were carried out on a Land Battery Measurement System (Land, China). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance were performed using a VMP3 Electrochemical Workstation (Bio-logic Inc.).
