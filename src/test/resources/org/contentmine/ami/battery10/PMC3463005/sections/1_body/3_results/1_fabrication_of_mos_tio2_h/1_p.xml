<p>Four typical MOs, namely, Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and CuO, are adopted as secondary nanostructures grown on primary TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofiber to verify the feasibility and versatility of our protocol in achieving MO/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures. We firstly test this concept with Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets grown on primary TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofiber to form the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures. The morphology of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>, the obtained pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> non-woven nanofibers with diameters ranging from 200 to 500 nm have a relatively smooth surface without secondary nanostructures. After applying the controllable solution growth of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets, the hierarchical heterostructures are formed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref>). Close observation on the nanofiber (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c</xref>) reveals that the high densities of secondary Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets grow on the primary TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. Interestingly, compared with the hierarchical heterostructures before annealing treatment (Fig. S1a and b), it is obvious that many pores caused by the annealing treatment are found on the surface of the secondary Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets. These pores may exhibit large surface area, which is very precious for LIBs materials. Further information about the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures is obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM image in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1d</xref> shows an individual Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical nanofiber. It can be clearly seen that the secondary Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets with many pores grow on the surface of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers, coinciding with the results from the SEM observations. The HRTEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref>) taken from the heterojunction region displays two set of lattice fringe spacings of 0.35 and 0.47 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of the anatase crystal structure of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and the (111) plane of the cubic Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively, which clearly shows the simultaneous presence of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> crystal lattices in the region of the junction. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1f</xref> shows the further magnified HRTEM image of the nanosheet, the measured lattice fringe spacings of 0.25 nm corresponding to the (311) plane of the cubic Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> can be clearly observed.
