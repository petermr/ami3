 <sub>2</sub>, as an important functional material, has numerous applications as photocatalysis, electronic devices, conversion devices as well as promising electrode material due to its attractive advantages of high abundance, low cost, better safety, and environmental friendliness

 <sup>−1</sup>) and the poor rate capability of TiO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> have been developed to overcome the ionic and electronic transport limitations and improve the rate capability of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-based anodes. However the strategies mentioned above still suffer from disadvantages such as high cost, complicated production procedure, and to add insult to injury decrease the capacity of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, because these coating materials are not very active materials for reversible lithium storage. Therefore, it is urgently important to develop new strategies that can coat the active materials with high capacity and conductivity on the surface of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures. On the other hand, as a new class of promising anode materials for LIBs, transition-metal oxides (MOs) have shown desirable property of higher theoretical capacities (700–1000 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is much higher than that of commercial graphite and TiO
 <sub>2</sub>)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. However, an intrinsically drastic volume change during lithiation/delithiation process gives rise to pulverization that may break the electrical contact pathways in the MOs electrodes, thus leading to a rapid decay in capacity and limiting the practical use. Therefore, developing new synthetic strategies to fabricate high-performance MOs electrode materials with both large reversible capacity and long cycle life are highly desirable but still very challenging.
