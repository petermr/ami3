 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It is noted that reversible formation could be electrochemically driven by the metal nanoparticles formed in situ. Hence, the presence of Co nanoparticles at the interface between TiO

 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> may improve the reversibility reaction of the anatase TiO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Interestingly, in present case, only one oxidation peak at about 2.1 V is observed, it is obvious that these two oxidation peaks coincide with each other. Note that, the second and onward CV curves remain steady, indicating the excellent cycle stability of the hierarchical heterostructures. Subsequently, the lithium storage performance of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures is investigated. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7b</xref> shows the discharge and charge curves at a current density of 200 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Consistent with the above CV analysis, the similar current peaks can be identified. These voltage profiles are characteristic of both Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-based and TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-based materials. It is observed that the initial discharge and charge capacities of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures electrode are 632.5 and 499.7 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, corresponding to an irreversible capacity loss of 21.0%. The capacity of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures electrode does not decay, and it can deliver a reversible capacity of 602.8 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> even after 480 cycles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7b and c</xref>). Importantly, the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures electrode still exhibits an excellent cyclic performance at a higher current density of 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the capacity still reaches 302.9 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 250 discharge and charge cycles (Fig. S4). In contrast, the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers electrode only exhibits a very lower capacity (initial discharge and charge capacities of 275.8 and 159.8 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and the single Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanostructures electrode loses the capacity severely (the discharge capacity of 381.4 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after only 90 charge-discharge cycles) (Fig. S5). Evidently, the composite hierarchical heterostructures inherit the advantages of high capacity from Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> component and the excellent stability of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> component. To better understand the advantage of the hierarchical heterostructures in lithium storage, the rate performance of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2 </sub>hierarchical heterostructures is investigated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7d</xref>). Obviously, compared with the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers, the specific capacity of the hierarchical heterostructures is substantially increased at all investigated charge-discharge rates from 100 to 2000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. For example, the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2 </sub>hierarchical heterostructures exhibit much superior rate performance with 475.8 and 449.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is about three times larger than that of pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> electrode (143.2 and 115.3 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>), at current densities of 400 and 1000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. At the high current rate (2000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>), the hierarchical heterostructures exhibit a downward trend, which can be ascribed to the partial collapse of the electrode materials during the charge–discharge at a high current density. Further investigations are ongoing to improve the capacity retention at high discharge rates. However, the difference of rate performance between the two materials is quite more remarkable even at high current density. Importantly, the high capacity of the hierarchical composite electrode can be recovered to the initial values even after 70 discharge and charge cycles, implying their good reversibility.
