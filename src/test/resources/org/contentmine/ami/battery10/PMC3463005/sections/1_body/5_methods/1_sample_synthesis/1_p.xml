<p>The MO/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical nanostructures were prepared by the electrospinning and hydrothermal method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Typically, 0.2429 g Co(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.25 g urea were dissolved in 25 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring. Then the resulting solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave with electrospun TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers (20 mg). The autoclave was sealed and heated at 120°C for 6 h, and cooled to room temperature. The film was collected out, washed with ethanol and deionized water, respectively, and then dried under vacuum at 50°C for 12 h. Then the as-collected films were calcined at 400°C for 4 h. For comparison, the single Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanostructures were also prepared under the same condition instead of the addition of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. When Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> precursor solution was replaced by Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> precursor solution (0.243 g FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> and 30 mL deionized water), Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> precursor solution (0.25 g FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.25 g polyethylene glycol, 0.9 g sodium acetate and 25 mL ethylene glycol), and CuO precursor solution (0.2557 g CuCl
 <sub>2</sub>·2H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.3 g urea and 30 mL deionized water), and the autoclave was sealed and heated at 90°C for 6 h (Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>), at 200°C for 16 h (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>), or at 180°C for 12 h (CuO), then the as-collected films were calcined at 500°C for 2 h except Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical nanofibers.
