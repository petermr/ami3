<p>The galvanostatic cycling characteristics of CuO-interlaced nanodiscs in the configuration of the CuO/Li half cell were investigated over a 0.01- to 3.0-V window at a rate of C/5 (based upon a theoretical capacity of 670 mA h g
 <sup>-1 </sup>by the conversion reaction, CuO + 2e
 <sup>- </sup>+ 2Li
 <sup>+ </sup>↔ Cu
 <sup>0 </sup>+ Li
 <sub>2</sub>O), as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The first discharge and charge capacities were 971 and 699 mA h g
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively. However, the capacity faded gradually from the subsequent cycle to a reversible capacity of 290 mA h g
 <sup>-1 </sup>after 20 cycles. Recently, Xiang 
 <italic>et al. </italic>reported the synthesis of shuttle-shaped CuO particles with a length of 1 μm and a thickness of 100-200 nm at 90°C using Cu(Ac)

 <sub>2</sub>O precursor, which have similar structures to our CuO-interlaced nanodiscs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We found that shuttle-shaped CuO (cycled at a rate of C/10) and our CuO-interlaced nanodiscs (cycled at a rate of C/5) showed similar electrochemical performance. The BET surface area of CuO-interlaced nanodiscs was estimated to be a relatively large value, approximately 60 m

 <sup>-1</sup>, but a significant impact on the electrochemical performance of this CuO-nanostructured electrode cannot be fully realized, possibly due to the aggregated CuO nanostructure (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>) and inhomogeneous mixing of conducting Super P carbon black with CuO nanostructures, which eventually increased the interparticle resistance, thereby degrading electrochemical performance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This detrimental phenomenon may also have been caused by the significant volume change upon cycling [
