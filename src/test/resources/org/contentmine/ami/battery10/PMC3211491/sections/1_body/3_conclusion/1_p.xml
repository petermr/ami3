<p>In summary, the successful low-temperature synthesis of phase-pure 2-D CuO-interlaced nanodiscs was demonstrated using simple dehydrogenation of 1-D Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>nanowires at 60Â°C in solution. The details of the growth aspects of the CuO-interlaced nanodiscs were suggested by the combined effects of the oriented attachment and subsequent dissolution-precipitation processes based on systematic temperature- and time-dependent morphology evolutions. These CuO nanostructures had a large surface area, approximately 60 m
 <sup>2 </sup>g
 <sup>-1</sup>, and the effects of their enhanced active sites by nanostructuring on the electrochemical performance of CuO could be further realized by the incorporation of MWCNTs.
