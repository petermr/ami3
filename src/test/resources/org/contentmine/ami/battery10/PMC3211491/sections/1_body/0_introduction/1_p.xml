<p>Inexpensive, environmentally innocuous, and easily producible cupric oxide (CuO) is an important p-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.2 eV that is widely studied in applications, including catalysts, gas sensors, photoconductive/photochemical cells, and other electronic devices [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, a great effort has recently been applied to the nanostructuring of CuO as it can deliver much higher reversible capacities than commercial graphite-based electrodes through the conversion reaction with Li (CuO + 2e
 <sup>- </sup>+ 2Li
 <sup>+ </sup>↔ Cu
 <sup>0 </sup>+ Li
 <sub>2</sub>O). Thus, various CuO nanostructures (nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes) have been shown to be good candidates as electrodes for lithium ion batteries [
