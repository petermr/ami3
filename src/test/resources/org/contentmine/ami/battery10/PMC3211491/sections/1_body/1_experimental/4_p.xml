<p>The electrochemical performance of each powder was evaluated by assembling Swagelok-type half cells, using a Li metal foil as the negative electrode. Positive electrodes were cast on Cu foil by mixing prepared powders (1.0-2.0 mg) with Super P carbon black (MMM Carbon, Brussels, Belgium) and the Kynar 2801 binder (PVdF-HFP) at a mass ratio of 70:15:15 in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis. MO, USA). A separator film of Celgard 2400 and liquid electrolyte (ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (1:1 by volume) with 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>, Techno Semichem Co., Ltd., Seongnam, South Korea) was also used. The assembled cells were galvanostatically cycled between 3.0 and 0.01 V using an automatic battery cycler (WBCS 3000, WonaTech, Seoul, South Korea). All cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s
