<p>The crystal structures and morphologies of each powder were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; model D/MAX-2500V/PC, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; model JSM-6330F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; model JEM-3000F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Additionally, the specific surface areas were examined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET; Belsorp-mini, BEL Japan Inc., Osaka, Japan) method with a nitrogen adsorption/desorption process.</p>
