 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c,d</xref> shows typical FESEM images of the CuO/MWCNT composite. MWCNTs were spatially dispersed in the composites without any appreciable agglomeration. In addition, the morphology of CuO in the composites was found to be mostly primary nanodiscs, not the interlaced disc nanostructures. It is believed that incorporation of MWCNT mitigated secondary nucleation and growth on the surface of the primary nanodiscs.
