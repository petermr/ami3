<p>Another feature in this CuO nanostructure was the interlaced nanodisc morphologies, namely the vertically interconnected structure with standing nanodiscs in the center part of the lying nanodiscs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). The morphological evolution of each intermediate phase is schematically illustrated in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>. As a detailed transformation process from Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>to CuO suggested by Cudennec 
 <italic>et al. </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the possible formation mechanism of the interlaced disc nanostructures can be suggested 
 <italic>via </italic>a different dissolution and recrystallization pathway, which can be supported by the coexistence of CuO nanodiscs and Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>nanowires (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As the reaction time was prolonged, a Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>with a different dissolution rate, resulting in a different nucleation rate and secondary nucleation, may occur at high-energy sites on the surface of the primary nanodiscs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Finally, one or more secondary standing nanodiscs gradually evolved into the larger lying flat nanodiscs, finally forming interlaced disc nanostructures, as reported in similar CuO nanostructures, by hydrothermal conversion from Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>at 100-130Â°C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the formation mechanism of the CuO-interlaced nanostructures during the phase conversion from Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>can be given 
 <italic>via </italic>combined effects of the oriented attachment and subsequent dissolution-precipitation processes.
