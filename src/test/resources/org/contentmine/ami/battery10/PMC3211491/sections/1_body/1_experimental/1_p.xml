<p>Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>nanowire precursors were prepared by a simple chemical solution route at room temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. First, 30 mL of 0.15 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>OH (28-30% as ammonia, NH
 <sub>3</sub>, Dae-Jung Chemical, Shiheung, South Korea) was added to 100 mL of 0.04 M copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>·5H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 99.5%, JUNSEI Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), followed by drop-wise addition of 6.0 mL of 1.2 M NaOH (98%, Dae-Jung Chemical, Shiheung, South Korea) under magnetic stirring. The Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>precipitate appeared in the blue solution. The as-prepared solution containing the Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>precursor was stored at room temperature for 1 h and heat-treated at 60°C for 3 h in a convection oven to produce CuO nanostructures. The black powders were centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and were dried overnight at 70°C in a vacuum oven.
