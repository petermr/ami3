<p>Cyclic voltammetry was recorded for pure CuO and CuO/MWCNT, as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. For both samples, the CV profiles were nearly identical to those reported for the CuO nanostructures [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Efficient electron transport by introducing MWCNT upon lithiation of the CuO was confirmed by the enhanced redox peaks in the CV curves (measured on samples of similar mass at the same voltage sweep rate). Therefore, it is believed that MWCNT improved the Li electroactivity of the CuO nanostructures because of its effect on conductivity and the efficient electron path [
