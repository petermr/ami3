<p>To understand the growth mechanism of the above CuO-interlaced nanodisc structures, temperature- and time-dependent experiments were carried out. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the series of typical FESEM images of samples taken after reaching a preset temperature and time. First, Cu
 <sup>2+ </sup>ions in the CuSO
 <sub>4 </sub>solution formed a square-planar complex [Cu(NH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>2+ </sup>upon addition of NH
 <sub>3</sub>OH at room temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. When NaOH was further added, Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>nanocrystals began to precipitate. The template-free formation of a 1-D nanowire morphology with a 30- to 50-nm diameter was due to the specific crystal structure of Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>(Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), because the growth of the layer-structured orthorhombic Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>along [100] was much faster than along any other direction, leading to a tendency to form a 1-D structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. With the increase in the reaction temperature from room temperature to 50Â°C, each nanowire was shortened and thickened laterally due to the oriented attachment of the Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>nanowires (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c,d</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Meanwhile, a gradual dehydration involving conversion from Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>to CuO might occur.
