<p>Lithium ion battery (LIB) has received wide-spread attention for large-scale power sources and promising energy storage devices owing to its high power, high energy density and long cyclelife

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Accordingly, there are increasing requirements for LIB key materials especially separator. LIB separator performed the crucial functions of physically separating the anode and cathode while permitting free flow of lithium ions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. It is well recognized that the microporous structure and thermal dimensional stability of separators considerably affect the battery performance, including power densities, cycle life and safety characteristics. Currently, polyolefin microporous membranes were the most widely used separators for commercial LIB due to their advantages, such as good electrochemical stability, proper thickness, and considerable mechanical strength

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Nevertheless, there is still quite challenging because polyolefin separators often suffer from poor electrolyte wettability and severe dimensional instability at an elevated operating temperature when the battery was running at high charge/discharge current
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Poor electrolyte wettability would lower rate capability of the battery because of high internal ionic resistance. In addition, severe dimensional instability may cause internal short-circuiting or lead to thermal runaway especially for use in batteries at high charge/discharge current. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop highly safe separators with good electrolyte wettability, superior thermal resistance and flame retardancy to improve safety issues of LIB.
