<p>Typical SEM images of PP separator, CN separator and FCCN separator were demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. PP separator showed uniform and typically elliptic pores, which were formed via a uniaxially stretching technology as revealed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The long axis of the pore was 100–500 nm and the short axis of about 50 nm. It was obviously observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> that CN separator consisted of randomly arranged fibers with diameter size of 2 ± 0.2 μm and it possessed excessively large-sized pores (&gt;4 μm). Because of large pore size, pristine CN separator generally suffered from internal short circuit ascribed to lithium dendrites during the charge–discharge process
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Compared with CN separator, FCCN separator (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c–d</xref>) presented distributed pores with diameters ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm, which was expected to play a critical role in preventing internal short-circuits, avoiding self-discharge and achieving uniform current density especially for batteries operating at high charge/discharge rates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In addition, this tortuous structure was favourable to prevent the growth of lithium dendrites, which was advantageous to battery safety
