<p>Cycling stability was also an important parameter for rating lithium ion battery

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref> presented the cycling stability of the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphite cells using PP separator and FCCN separator at 0.5 C/0.5 C up to 200 cycles. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref>, the cells with FCCN separator showed stable cycling performance and higher capacity retention ratio than that of PP separator after 200 cycles. The obtained capacity retention after 200 cycles for the cells was 75% for FCCN separator and 61% for PP separator, respectively. The better cycling stability of the cells using FCCN separator could be attributed to its better electrolyte retention and more compatible interface than that of PP separator
