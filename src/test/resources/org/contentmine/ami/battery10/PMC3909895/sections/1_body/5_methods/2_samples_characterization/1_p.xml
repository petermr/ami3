<p>The morphology of the separators was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800 at 3 kV). The thickness of each separator was measured using a micrometer. The air permeability was obtained using a Gurley-type densometer (4110N, Gurley) by measuring the time of 100 cc air to pass through the separator. The porosity was measured by immersing the separator into n-butanol for 2 h and calculating with the following equation: Eq. (1): P = [(m
 <sub>b</sub>/ρ
 <sub>b</sub>)/(m
 <sub>b</sub>/ρ
 <sub>b</sub> + m
 <sub>a</sub>/ρ
 <sub>a</sub>)] × 100%, where m
 <sub>a</sub> and m
 <sub>b</sub> were the mass of the separator and n-butanol, ρ
 <sub>a</sub> and ρ
 <sub>b</sub> were the density of separator material and n-butanol, respectively. The liquid electrolyte uptake was determined by following Eq. (2): EU = [(W − W
 <sub>o</sub>)/W
 <sub>o</sub>] × 100%, where W
 <sub>o</sub> and W indicated the separator weight before and after liquid electrolyte absorption, respectively. The extra solution (n-butanol or electrolyte) at the surface of the separator was absorbed with a filter paper before measuring the weight. Contact angle measurement was performed using a JC2000C Contact Angle Meter. Contact angle of 5 μL electrolyte droplet was measured using a JC2000C Contact Angle Meter. Tortuosity of the membranes was calculated by using the relationship:

 </inline-formula>, where 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>σ</italic> are the conductivity of the neat liquid electrolyte and electrolyte-soaked membrane, respectively, and P is the porosity of membrane. The stress-strain curves of the separators were tested using an Instron-3300 universal tensile tester (USA) at a speed of 10 mm min
 <sup>−1</sup> using samples with 1 cm in width and 8 cm in length. Young's modulus (E) can be calculated with the following equation: Eq. (3): E = σ/ε, where σ and ε stress and strain of the separator. Differential scanning calorimeter (Diamond DSC, PerkinElmer) was used to evaluate the thermal properties of the separators. Samples were scanned from 50°C to 300°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min under a N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. To evaluate its thermal shrinkage behavior, the separator was placed in an oven and heated at 150°C for 0.5 h. Thermal shrinkage ratio (TSR) was calculated according to Eq. (4): TSR (%) = (S
 <sub>o</sub> − S/S
 <sub>o</sub>) × 100%. Here, S
 <sub>o</sub> and S represent the area of the separator before and after thermal treatment at a series of temperature for 0.5 h, respectively. Contact test between hot electric iron tip and separator was performed as follows: Soldering iron tip was first heated to 400°C and contacted to separator gently for 1 second, then recorded the changes of surface morphology of separator. Limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurement was undertaken using JF-3 type oxygen index tester (China). Heat release value was determined by automatic oxygen bomb calorimeter (IKA C200, German).
