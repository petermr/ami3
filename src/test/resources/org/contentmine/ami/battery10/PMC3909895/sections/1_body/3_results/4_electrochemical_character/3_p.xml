 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5</xref> depicted the interfacial compatibility of the liquid electrolyte-soaked separators with a lithium metal anode, which was characterized by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It could be observed that the interfacial resistance was 170 Ω for FCCN separator and 350 Ω for PP separator, respectively. Obviously, the interfacial property between anode and separator can be significantly improved in the case of FCCN separator, which indicated that FCCN separator could endow better interfacial characteristics for lithium battery separator
