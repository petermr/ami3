 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S4</xref> showed the Nyquist plots of liquid electrolyte-soaked PP separator and FCCN separator. The intercept of the semicircle with the real axis was the electrolyte bulk resistance (R
 <sub>b</sub>). The ionic conductivity was then calculated from the R
 <sub>b</sub> values by employing the formula: σ = L/R
 <sub>b</sub>A, where L was the thickness of the separator sample and A was the contact area between the separator and the electrode. It can be obtained that the ionic conductivity of FCCN separator was 2.0 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which was much higher than that of PP separator (0.65 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The interconnected porous structure and polar chemical composition of FCCN separator was benificial to higher ionic conductivity
