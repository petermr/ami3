<p>A separator should possess good electrolyte wettability to retain the electrolyte efficiently during the charge/discharge process
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Contact angle between the separators and liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in EC/DMC) were conducted to characterize the electrolyte wettability of PP separator and FCCN separator. It was clearly displayed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> that the contact angle of PP separator (84°) was much higher than that of FCCN separator (15°), which confirmed that FCCN separator exhibited better electrolyte wettability than PP separator
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The electrolyte wettability rate of PP separator and FCCN separator were also evaluated by comparing the electrolyte immersion-height of the separators (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1</xref>). Obviously, the immersion-height of FCCN separator (2.9 cm) was greater than that of PP separator (0.2 cm). The higher immersion-height verified that FCCN separator was more lyophilic to liquid electrolyte. As a method for quantitative testing, the electrolyte uptake was listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The electrolyte uptake of FCCN separator was 270%, which was higher than that of PP separator (125%). This remarkable liquid electrolyte wettability of FCCN separator may be ascribed to the well interconnected microporous structure and the intrinsically lyophilic nature of cellulose material. Thus, high porosity, lower Gurley value, and superior electrolyte wettability of FCCN separator were beneficial to improve the rate capability and cycling stability of LIB
