<p>Thermal shrinkage of the separator was another essential factor to evaluate safety characteristics and battery performance of the lithium ion battery

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref>, FCCN separator exhibited negligible thermal shrinkage than that of PP separator over a wider range of temperatures. A separator must be qualified to prevent the electrodes from contacting one another at elevated temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref> was the photograph of PP separator and FCCN separator after thermal treatment at 150°C for 0.5 h. It can be found that FCCN separator exhibited negligible dimension change, while the PP separator generated significant shrinkage (&gt;40%) which verified FCCN separator to exhibit excellent thermal dimensional stability. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref> showed contact test between hot electric iron tip and separators. Obviously, the hole-area of PP separator propagated after hot soldering iron tip contacting test, which was detrimental to ensure safety of battery. While FCCN separator was extremely safe and had no hole. This superior thermal tolerance could effectively prevent internal electrical short circuit at elevated temperatures when the battery was operated at high charged/discharged rates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Thus, FCCN separator was an advanced separator for application in LIB with requested thermal safety.
