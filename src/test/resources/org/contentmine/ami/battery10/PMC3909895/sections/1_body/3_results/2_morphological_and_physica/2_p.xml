<p>Physical and electrochemical parameters of PP separator and FCCN separator were listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. It should be noted that Gurley value of FCCN separator was 45 s, which was much lower than that of PP separator (235 s). It was well known that lower Gurley value of FCCN separator was attributed to highly porous structure of the membrane, which was well consistent with the SEM analysis. The improvement in the microporous structure of the separator was further confirmed by the porosity. Obviously, the porosity of FCCN separator (70%) was fairly higher than that of PP separator (55%). Tortuosity was used to provide information regarding the transport of ions on the effect of pore blockage, which was calculated from the porosity and the ionic conductivity

 <italic>τ</italic> &gt; 1 is good for dendrite resistance but can lead to higher separator resistance. Here the 
 <italic>τ</italic> value of FCCN separator was observed to encompass lower tortuosity value compared to PP separator favoring the dendrite resistance as well as reducing the separator resistance reasonably
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. High porosity can result in high electrolyte uptake, and consequently lead to high ionic conductivity of electrolyte-soaked FCCN separator, which was favourable to facilitate rapid ionic transportation
