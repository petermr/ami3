<p>For practical battery applications, it is important to investigate the cycle performance not only at room temperature, but also at elevated temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Herein, we selected LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> as the preferred cathode material owing to its better performance at elevated temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> depicted cycle performance and charge/discharge curves of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/Li cells using PP separator and FCCN separator at 120°C. As revealed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref>, the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/Li cell using FCCN separator exhibited much better cycling performance than PP separator. Moreover, it can be easily observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6b</xref> that the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/Li cell using FCCN separator can sustain stable charge/discharge curves, in contrast, PP separator could not even be stably charged and discharged at 120°C. The main reason was associated with significant thermal shrinkage of PP separator at the elevated temperature, which caused internal short-circuits in the cell. These results demonstrated that FCCN separator possessed better thermal stability and would enhance safety characteristic of LIB. From the above mentioned discussion, it is abundantly clear that FCCN nonwoven is very promising for high-power LIB separator.
