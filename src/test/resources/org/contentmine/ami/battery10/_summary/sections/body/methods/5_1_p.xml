<p>CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables were synthesized by hydrothermal method and subsequent thermally treatment. Briefly, 1.0 ml titanium isopropoxide (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 g glucose (Alfa Aesar), and 30 mg CNT (multiwalled carbon nanotube, Sigma-Aldrich, carbon &gt;90%, trace metal basis) were added in 15 ml alcohol. The solution was further sonicated for 1 h, then transferred into an autoclave, and kept at a temperature of 180°C for 40 h. The resulting black solid products were centrifuged, washed ethanol several times, and then dried at 75°C in a drying oven. Finally, the products were treated in a tubular furnace at 500°C for 3 h under N2 at a ramping rate of 5°C/min. CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites were synthesized by the same method as described above, except that there was no glucose involved.
