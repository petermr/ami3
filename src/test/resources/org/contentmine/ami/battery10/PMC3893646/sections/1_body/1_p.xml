<p>To address this issue, many kinds of nanostructures with different morphologies and different hierarchical structures have been investigated
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Tailoring the particle size of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and constructing porous channel in the material are employed to improve the practical capacity and the rate capability of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> anode. The nanosized particles with large specific surface area decrease the current density per unit surface area and shorten the Li
 <sup>+</sup>-diffusion length in the solid phase, thus enabling Li
 <sup>+</sup> to transport rapidly into the interior of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, the significant increase of the surface and the interface area in nanosized materials can improve the capacity beyond that of conventional bulk materials

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Enhancing the electrochemical performances–high specific capacity (Li
 <sub>x</sub>TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (x&gt;0.5)) and high-rate capability–are thus obtained accordingly using porous and nanometer-sized TiO
 <sub>2</sub> electrode

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Another way to improve the electronic conductivity of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is to connect nanostructured TiO
 <sub>2</sub> materials with highly conductive materials to yield a hybrid nanostructure. High rate capability has been reported for nanostructured networks of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-RuO
 <sub>2</sub> composites
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-carbon nanotube(CNT) hybrid structures

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and carbon-coating TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Among various conductive materials, the one-dimensional CNT with high electronic conductivity, high mechanical strength, and large-scale availability is an ideal conducting substrate; thus it is widely investigated in the field of energy conversion and storage
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, pristine CNTs synthesized by chemical vapor deposition are hydrophobic. As a result, it is difficult for TiO
 <sub>2</sub> to directly nucleate and grow on the surface of pristine CNTs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> Therefore, two main challenges are posed for synthesizing hybrid CNT-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> materials for high-performance anodes of LIBs. The first issue is how to improve the interfacial interaction between TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and CNTs. And another issue is how to control TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particle size while introducing a porous surface. It was previously reported that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of CNT introduced by strong acid oxidation could provide covalent-bonding interfacial interaction between the titanate sol and CNTs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, the acid oxidation treatments also inevitably shorten the CNT and destroy the structure of CNT which degrade its electronic conductivity and mechanical strength. Recently, Eder 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> reported a non-covalent process to enable coating of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> on the CNTs by using benzyl alcohol (BA) as the surfactant. The phenyl ring of the BA attached to the graphitic surface of CNTs 
 <italic>via</italic> π–π stacking, and then the hydroxyl group of the BA interacted directly with the precursors in the sol-gel process as linkers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Hence, BA enables the synthesis of CNT-inorganic hybrid materials without the requirement of covalent functionalization of CNT. However, the uses of extra additives undoubtedly increase the synthesis complexity, the cost, and pose potential hazards to the environment. Therefore, it is highly desirable but quite challenging to design a simple and green route to integrate TiO
 <sub>2</sub> with highly conductive CNTs at nanoscale for using as high-performance anode material.
