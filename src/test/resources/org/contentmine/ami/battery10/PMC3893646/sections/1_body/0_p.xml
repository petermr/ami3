 <sub>2</sub> with different polymorphs (anatase, rutile, and bronze) has been extensively studied as an alternative to the carbonaceous anode for LIBs. Anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> as an anode material has generated special interests owing to its high electrochemical activity, low toxicity, chemical stability, low price, and safety. Its high lithium ion insertion/extraction potential at ~1.7 V (versus Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li) is inherently safe because of avoiding the Li-dendrite electroplating. Furthermore, the limited volume change (less than 4%) during the Li
 <sup>+</sup> insertion/extraction process leads to an enhanced structural stability and a prolonged cycling life

 <sub>2</sub> and the limited specific capacity (Li
 <sub>x</sub>TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (x≤0.5), x = 0.5, 168 mAh/g) pose challenges to meet the requirements for high-power-density and high-energy-density LIBs.
