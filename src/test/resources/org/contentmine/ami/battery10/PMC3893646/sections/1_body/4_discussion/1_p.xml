<p>To understand the electrochemical behavior of this hybrid material, we investigated the performance of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable as an anode material of LIBs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable electrode for the first five scans at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Two peaks at approximately 1.73 V (cathodic) and 1.98 V (anodic) are associated with Li
 <sup>+</sup> insertion/extraction into/from the anatase. It is worth noting that the CV curve shows an ideal rectangular shape in the range of 1.0–1.7 V, which is characteristic of charging/discharging of supercapacitance contributed from the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and carbon. Furthermore, these peaks show almost no change in amplitude and voltage positions during the subsequent several cycles, indicating good stability and high reversibility of the electrochemical reaction presented in
