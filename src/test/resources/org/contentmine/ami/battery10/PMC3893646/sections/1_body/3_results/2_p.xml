<p>The XRD pattern of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>. The diffraction pattern is in good agreement with anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 21-1272). Raman spectra were carried out to investigate the crystalline phase of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and the carbon type in the nanocable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Four peaks with strong intensities at 146, 395, 515, and 635 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be observed in the Raman spectra of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable, which are well consistent with that of reported anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Furthermore, two characteristic peaks located at about 1372 and 1592 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> correspond to disorder carbon (D-band) and graphite carbon (G-band) in the nanocable, respectively. The peak intensity ratio of D-band and G-band (I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub>) is found to be 1.5 for CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable compared with the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> value of pristine CNTs (about 1.0), which clearly demonstrates the existence of amorphous carbon in CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable. The total carbon content including carbon nanotube and amorphous carbon is directly obtained from the TGA (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supplementary Fig. S4</xref> online).
