<p>It is worth pointing out that the synthetic methodology used in this study is very simple and green, compared to the previously reported method with more complex synthetic procedures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, which is promising for many industrial applications. We anticipate that the one-pot synthesis method proposed in this study will provide more choices for addressing the problems of LIBs.
