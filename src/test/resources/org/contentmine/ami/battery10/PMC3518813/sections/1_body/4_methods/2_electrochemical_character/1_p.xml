<p>Cyclic voltammograms were performed in a Swagelok-type cell using 
 <italic>AUTO LAB PGSTAT 302</italic> potentiostat/galvanostat (Eco Chemie Utrecht, Netherlands) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were conducted using an Arbin battery analyzer (USA). The working electrode with a thickness of 0.2 mm and a diameter of 12 mm was fabricated by mixing 80% of the active materials with 20% carbon black and coated onto a stainless steel (SS) plate. The electrochemical test cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box using the active material (purpurin and CLP) as working electrode, lithium metal foil as the counter/reference electrode and 1 M solution of LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). A glass microfiber filter was used as separator. The cell charge/discharge was performed between 3.7 V and 1.5 V vs Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at different current rates.
