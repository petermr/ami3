<p>The broadband decoupled 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum of purpurin exhibited carbonyl carbon peaks at around δ 181 and 188 ppm and the carbon attached to hydroxyl group appeared at δ 150, 158 and 161 ppm. Depending on the extent of lithiation, the carbonyl carbons displayed slight upfield shifts, whereas the aromatic carbons attached to the hydroxyl group exhibited downfield shifts (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a–d</xref> display the overlayed 
 <sup>13</sup>C-DEPT-135 spectra of pristine purpurin, ELP-1, ELP-2 and CLP, where only the proton bearing carbons are detected. Strikingly, the C
 <sub>d</sub> carbon shifted upfield from 110.3 ppm in pure purpurin to 104.4 ppm, depending on the extent of lithiation process. In addition, the observations from 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR are further supported by 
 <sup>7</sup>Li NMR as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3</xref>.
