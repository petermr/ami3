<p>After understanding the actual lithiation and de-lithiation potentials of the purpurin molecules from cyclic voltammogram measurements, another test cell was constructed and tested for their electrochemical performance in Li half-cells. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were conducted between 3.7 V and 1.5 V

 <sup>+</sup>, clearly indicate a typical Li lithiation/de-lithiation behavior. During the first discharge, an initial drop in the potential to 2.5 V is observed and then a stable plateau occurs between 2.5 V and 2.3 V before dropping to 1.5 V. A first discharge capacity of ~196 mAh/g is observed. Upon recharge, de-lithiation of purpurin takes place in two steps observed in the form of two plateau regions from 2.2 V to 2.7 V and 2.7 V to 3.3 V. Thus the observed charge/discharge behavior from galvanostatic measurement is in good agreement with cyclic voltammogram measurements. The capacity loss in the subsequent cycles is attributed to irreversible process

 <italic>vs</italic> voltage (first cycle of discharge/charge) profiles of purpurin at current rates of C/2, C/10 and C/20 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1(c)</xref>. The contour of the voltage 
 <italic>vs</italic> specific capacity curve at higher current rates of C/2 is very similar to the one obtained at lower current rates. The discharge capacity of the first discharge cycle at a current rate of C/20 is much higher than that of C/10 and C/2. The decrease in specific capacity at higher current rates is due to poor electron conductivity of purpurin molecule. We have also compared the battery performance of pristine purpurin molecules with that of CLP by constructing another cell with CLP (80%)/carbon (20%) as working electrode. The voltage
