<p>To realize the reversible electrochemical performance of this novel electrode material, a working electrode was prepared by mixing 80% of purpurin/CLP and 20% of carbon by weight. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1 (a)</xref> shows the cyclic voltammogram of the purpurin electrode conducted at scan rate of 0.1 mVs
 <sup>−1</sup> in 1 M solution of LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as an electrolyte against Li metal as counter and reference electrode. The cyclic voltammogram measurement of the purpurin electrodes showed reversible lithiation/de-lithiation process in purpurin molecule. The first cathodic scan showed a peak around ~2 V. As it can be observed from the cathodic scan of the cyclic voltammogram the lithiation process begins at 2.4 V and becomes quite large at ~2.0 V. The first anodic scan shows two small peaks around ~2.6 and 3.2 V respectively, associated with the de-lithiation process of purpurin. In the following scans of the cyclic voltammogram, the peaks of the cathodic scan shifts to the right by ~0.2 V, hence reducing the hysteresis between the anodic and cathodic peaks. This leads to better reversibility of the electrode around ~2.0 V.
