 <caption> (a) Cyclic voltammograms of purpurin electrode in 1 M solution of LiPF 6 in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the electrolyte with Li as counter and reference electrode (scan rate: 0.1 mVs −1). (b) Voltage vs specific charge-discharge capacity of purpurin electrode cycled at a C/20 rate between 3.7 V and 1.5 V vs Li/Li + in 1 M solution of LiPF 6 in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the electrolyte. (c) The voltage profiles of purpurin at different current rates (C/2, C/10 and C/20). The first charge/discharge curves are presented in the plot and (d) Voltage vs specific charge-discharge capacity of CLP electrode cycled at a C/20 rate between 3.7 V and 1.5 V vs Li/Li + in 1 M solution of LiPF 6 in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the electrolyte. Inset: Variation in discharge capacity vs cycle number for the CLP electrode. </caption>
