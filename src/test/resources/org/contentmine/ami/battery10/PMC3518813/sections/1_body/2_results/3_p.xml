<p>The possible sequence of lithiation/de-lithiation mechanism in the purpurin molecule is schematically represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">figure 2 (a)</xref>. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">figure 2</xref>, (1) Molecular structure of pristine purpurin and corresponding hydrogen were labeled as H
 <sub>a</sub>–H
 <sub>h</sub> respectively. Possible lithium binding core in purpurin is shown by orange color circles; (2) Possible reversible intermediate of lithiated purpurin and (3) Binding of lithium ion with carbonyl groups of purpurin and hydroxyl groups at C-1 (–OH
 <sub>a</sub>) and C-4 (–OH
 <sub>c</sub>) respectively. Upon lithiation of purpurin, existence of different forms of molecular structures, 1–3 are proposed based on detailed NMR spectral analysis of the lithiated purpurin electrode (ELP) as well as CLP, and were supported by UV-vis and FTIR studies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2 (b)</xref> Photograph of (1) Pristine purpurin and (2) Chemically lithiated purpurin (1:2 ratio). Further, to understand the electrochemical reaction mechanism between purpurin and lithium, NMR, FTIR, UV and XPS measurements were carried out on ELP and compared the obtained spectra with that of pristine purpurin. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C and 
 <sup>7</sup>Li NMR spectral data of CLP, where LiOAc acted as source for Li ions, are in good agreement with the electrochemically modified system (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2 and Figure S3</xref>). NMR studies clearly depict the binding of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions with carbonyls and simultaneously with the nearby hydroxyl groups of purpurin (
