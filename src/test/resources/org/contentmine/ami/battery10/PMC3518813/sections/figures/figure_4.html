 <caption> The expanded 13C DEPT-135 NMR spectrum recorded in DMSO- d 6 at 125 MHz at 25°C. (a) Pristine purpurin; (b) ELP-1; (c) ELP-2 and (d) CLP (1:2 ratio). In DEPT 135, 13C signals arising due to methyl (–CH 3) &amp; methine (–CH) appear positive, methylene as negative (–CH 2) whereas no quaternary carbons show up. The progress of lithiation and its corresponding carbon chemical shifts were examined. The inset shows the molecular structure of purpurin with carbon labeling as C a–C d respectively. </caption>
