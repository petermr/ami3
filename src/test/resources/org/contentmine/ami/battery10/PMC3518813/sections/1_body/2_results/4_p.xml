<p>A careful examination of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-DEPT-135 NMR data in DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub> clearly indicates the nature and extent of lithium incorporation into purpurin. 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR of the pristine purpurin showed multiplets at δ 7.8–8.1 ppm for the C-ring, a singlet at δ 6.58 ppm for the A-ring proton and singlets for the hydroxyl groups at δ 13.30, 13.05 and 11.57 ppm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref>). The broad singlet at δ 11.57 ppm was assigned to the phenolic hydroxyl groups (H
 <sub>b</sub>), as it was broad due to weak intra-molecular H-bonding and chemical exchange. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR of ELP-1 and of pristine purpurin, were found to be similar except for the phenolic hydroxyl groups (H
 <sub>a</sub>, H
 <sub>b</sub> and H
 <sub>c</sub>) and the aromatic proton (H
 <sub>d</sub>) in A-ring. Lithiation process in purpurin was identified by waning of phenolic hydroxyl groups (–OH
 <sub>a</sub> and –OH
 <sub>c</sub>), upfield shift of aromatic H
 <sub>d</sub> proton and downfield shift of –OH
 <sub>b</sub> signal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a–e</xref>). In case of 1:1 ratio of purpurin with LiOAc, –OH
 <sub>b</sub> shifted downfield to δ 16.58 ppm and the H
 <sub>d</sub> proton shifted upfield to δ 5.65 ppm. Upon increasing the purpurin-LiOAc concentration to 1:2 ratio, the –OH
 <sub>b</sub> signal shifted downfield at δ 18.12 ppm, whereas H
 <sub>d</sub> shifted upfield to δ 5.58 ppm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3a, 3d, 3e</xref>). A similar trend was also observed in ELP-2, where –OH
 <sub>b</sub> proton shifted downfield to δ 18.19 ppm from δ 13.91 [ELP-1] and 11.58 ppm [pristine purpurin] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3a, 3b, 3c</xref>). Likewise, the H
 <sub>d</sub> proton shifted upfield to δ 5.55 ppm from δ 6.35 and 6.58 ppm in ELP-1 and in pure purpurin, respectively. The extreme downfield shifts of the enolic –OH
 <sub>b</sub> group is attributed to the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl conjugation. The extent of downfield shift depends on the equilibrium between the mono- and di-lithiated species. When the di-lithiated species dominate, the –OH
 <sub>b</sub> resonance has a maximum downfield of δ 18.14 ppm, which was observed in ELP-2 and chemically lithiated purpurin (1:2 ratio).
