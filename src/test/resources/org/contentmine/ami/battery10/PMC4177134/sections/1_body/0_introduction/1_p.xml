<p>Graphite has been extensively used as a negative electrode material due to its relatively high specific capacity and electrochemical stability [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, several issues were brought about due to inherent electrochemical characteristics of graphite; electrodeposition of lithium at the surface of graphite during quick charging, and a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation by the secondary reactions between graphite and electrolyte. These problems deteriorated the performance of the graphite electrode, resulting in shorter lifetime and reduced capacity. Thus, an alternative electrode material has been actively explored to replace it. In particular, electric vehicles requiring fast charging need electrode materials not only experiencing little lattice distortions during chargeâ€“discharge cycles, but having a long lifetime, high stability, and high discharging capacity, etc. And most of all, they need to be fabricated at a reasonably low cost.
