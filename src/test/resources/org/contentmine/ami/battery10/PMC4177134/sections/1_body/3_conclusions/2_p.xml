 <sub>2</sub>(B) sample ball milled for 1 hr also showed a very high stability during charge–discharge cyclic tests. : It maintained about 98% of the initial discharge capacity during 50 cycles while as-synthesized and 3 hrs ball milled samples showed a gradual decrease in the capacity with the cycles.
