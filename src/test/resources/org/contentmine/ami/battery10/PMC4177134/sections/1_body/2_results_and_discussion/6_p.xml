<p>Cyclic stability of charge–discharge capacity and capacity variation as a function of C-rate was compared among the samples in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. As can be seen in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>(a), TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) sample ball milled 1 hr showed a high degree of cyclic stability. About 98% of the initial discharge capacity was maintained even after 50 cycles; initial capacity of 232 mAh/g was reduced only to 227 mAh/g. On the other hand, as-synthesized sample and 3 hrs ball milled sample showed a gradual decrease of the capacity with the cycle suggesting smaller particle size without anatase phase in TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) was an optimum condition for the high electrochemical performance. Discharging capacity was gradually decreased with the C-rate regardless of the sample types as compared in graph Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>(b). But the gaps in the initial capacity among the samples were observed to be kept during the whole measurements in the C-rate range of 0.2 – 10 C.
