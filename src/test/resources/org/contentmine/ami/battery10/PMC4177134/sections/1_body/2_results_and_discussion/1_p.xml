<p>TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders were synthesized by the heat treatment of the rod or belt-shaped H-titanate powders at 450°C for 6 hrs, which had been prepared by a hydrothermal process. The combined process of the hydrothermal and heat treatment has been used for the synthesis of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The synthesized TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders were ball milled using a planetary type ball mill at a fixed rotation speed of 300 rpm for up to 3 hrs to make them smaller sizes. The changes of morphology and size of the powders with the milling time were observed under SEM as shown in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The as-synthesized TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders were observed from Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(a) to be long rod or belt shaped. The powders were broken into smaller sizes after 1 hr ball milling (Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(b)). However, they became severely agglomerated after ball milling for 3 hrs as can be seen in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(c). The size distribution of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders with the milling time was graphed in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. As-synthesized TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders with an average of 24 μm became broken into smaller sizes of 0.7 and 0.2 μm after ball milling for 1 and 3 hrs, respectively.
