<p>In this study, we obtained belt or wire shaped TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) particles to use as a negative electrode by a hydrothermal and heat treatment process. Ball milling process was utilized to crush the synthesized TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) particles into smaller sizes to facilitate TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B)/C composites fabrication. The effects of ball mill treatment on the electrochemical performance of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) particles were evaluated in terms of microstructure and phase changes.
