<p>Raman spectra showed that as-synthesized sample was composed of primarily TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) with the minor phase of anatase as seen in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>(b). However, intensity of the anatase became stronger with the ball milling time, resulting in a dominant phase after ball milling for 3 hrs.
