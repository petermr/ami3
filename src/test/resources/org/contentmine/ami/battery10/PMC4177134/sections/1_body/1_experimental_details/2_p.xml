<p>Electrochemical properties were measured with R2032 coin-type cells. A metal lithium foil was used as the anode. Composite electrodes were prepared by mixing 80 wt% TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders, 10 wt% conductive Super-P, 10 wt% SBR-CMC binder, and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form uniform slurry. A solution of 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 w/w) was used as the electrolyte. The cells were charged and discharged between 1.0 and 3.0 V by applying a constant current of 50 mAg
