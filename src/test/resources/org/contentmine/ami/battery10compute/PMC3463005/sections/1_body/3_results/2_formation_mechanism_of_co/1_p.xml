<p>Based on the above analysis, combining the versatility of the electrospinning technique and hydrothermal growth enables the fabrication of MO/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures. Evidently, no surface pretreatments are needed to introduce new surface functional groups or additional covalent and/or noncovalent interconnectivity in our experiments. Subsequently, we take Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures as an example and investigate the formation mechanism of hierarchical heterostructures, as illustrated in
