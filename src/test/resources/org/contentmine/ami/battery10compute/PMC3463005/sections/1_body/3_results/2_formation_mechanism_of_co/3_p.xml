<p>Based on the time-dependent experiments, the possible mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of these hierarchical heterostructures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6g</xref>). Firstly, the electrospun TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers provide negative charges on the surface, which is demonstrated by its negative zeta potential (−29.4 mV). It is well known that when two components with opposite charges are carefully introduced together, the mutual electrostatic interactions drive Co
 <sup>2+</sup> to attach on the surfaces of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. Then, the reaction of Co
 <sup>2+</sup> and urea takes place and the formed cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate nuclei attach to the surface of pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. In the reaction, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers are used as the substrate, which can guide the secondary nanoparticles self-assembling growth in aqueous solution without surfactant and stabilizers. In this key step, the uniform small nuclei are very important because they could determine the growth kinetics of the nanosheets on the surface of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers

 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. With our starting chemical precursors, the formation of the cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate phase can be demonstrated by the XRD patterns (Fig. S3), which agrees well with previous reports

 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> induced by the thermal annealing. Upon annealing for 4 h in air, cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate decomposes gradually and black Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets are obtained accordingly. Obviously, large quantities of pores are widely distributed on the surface of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets, the yield of which would mainly rely on the pyrolysis of hydroxide-carbonate and the release of gases (CO
 <sub>2</sub>, H
 <sub>2</sub>O) during the calcination process
