<p>To get more insight into the actual evolution process of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures, a series of time-dependent experiments is conducted, and the intermediate solids at the different reaction stages (nucleation, growth, etc.) are examined. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a-f</xref> show representative SEM images for the samples collected stepwise after 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 9 h of reaction. These sequential images reveal a morphological and structural transformation from pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers to Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical nanofibers. Evidently, in the initial stage (1 h) of the hydrothermal reaction, there is no visible change to the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, after 1.5 h growth, tiny nanowires nucleated on the surfaces of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers are observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6b</xref>). When the reaction time is extended to 2 h, although a few nanosheets have already formed, most TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers appeared to be surrounded by tiny nanowires (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6c</xref>). When the reaction time is further extended to 4 h, the continuous growth results in the disappearance of the tiny nanowires. As a result, the secondary nanosheets grow on the primary TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6d</xref>). However, by further increasing the reaction time, the overall morphology scarcely shows any change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6e and f</xref>).
