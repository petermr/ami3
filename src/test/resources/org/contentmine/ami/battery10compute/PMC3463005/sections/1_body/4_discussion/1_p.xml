<p>The above obtained improved electrochemical properties of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2 </sub>hierarchical heterostructures are not simply a result of the mix of the two components. Instead, it more likely originates from the successful integration of the respective advantages from both TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> individual components into the unique hierarchical heterostructures, which is elaborated as follows. On one hand, the improved capacity of hierarchical heterostructures compared with the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers can be easily understood by the addition of a higher capacity Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> component and the synergistic effect of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets and TiO
 <sub>2</sub> stems mentioned above. It is well-known that one advantage of transition-metal oxides in lithium storage is their high theoretical specific capacity. Hence, a large content of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> could give rise to a high specific capacity. On the other hand, the synergistic effect of the successful integration of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets and TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers contributes more to the improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2 </sub>hierarchical heterostructures. Herein, the reason can be the following: the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets with many spaces each other have an increased portion of exposed surfaces and ensure a high utilization of electrode materials, thus a high capacity. Besides, the ultralong hierarchical heterostructures can suppress the self-aggregation, buffer the volume changes of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets, and keep the effective contact areas of active materials and electrolyte large and sufficient during the cycling, thereby resulting in better cyclic stability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Specifically, in comparison with the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers, the highly dense Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets grow on the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers substrate orderly. This structure can provide more electrochemically active sites and sufficient order to enable Li
 <sup>+</sup> access to the heterostructures facilely. In addition to the improved cycling stability, the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2 </sub>hierarchical heterostructures also exhibit excellent rate capability with respect to the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. Therefore, the difference in the conductivity between them should be taken into account. To probe the kinetic properties of the hierarchical heterostructures, we take the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. All three plots show partially overlapping semicircles at high-to-medium frequencies, and a line was observed at low frequencies in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>. Apparently, the charge transfer resistances R
 <sub>ct</sub> for the three samples is in the ascending order of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (730.0 Ω) &gt; Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (170.9 Ω) &gt; Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (137.2 Ω), whilst the contact resistances (see the intercept of the real axis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>) between electrolyte and electrode materials are similar, which indicates that the secondary Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanosheets coating could enable much easier charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface (compared with TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers) and boost the electronic conductivity. Thus, the improved electronic conductivity is considered to be a key factor in improving the rate capability and cyclic life of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2 </sub>hierarchical heterostructures.
