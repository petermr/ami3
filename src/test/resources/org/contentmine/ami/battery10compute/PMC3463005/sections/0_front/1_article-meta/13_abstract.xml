 <p>We demonstrate a simple, efficient, yet versatile strategy for the synthesis of novel hierarchical heterostructures composed of TiO
  <sub>2</sub> nanofiber stem and various metal oxides (MOs) secondary nanostructures, including Co
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>, Fe
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub>, Fe
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>, and CuO, by advantageously combining the versatility of the electrospinning technique and hydrothermal growth method, for which the controllable formation process and possible formation mechanism are also investigated. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept demonstration of the functional properties of these hierarchical heterostructures, the Co
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>/TiO
  <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures are investigated as the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anode materials for the first time, which not only delivers a high reversible capacity of 632.5â€…mAh g
  <sup>-1</sup> and 95.3% capacity retention over 480 cycles, but also shows excellent rate capability with respect to the pristine TiO
  <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. The synergetic effect between Co
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> and TiO
  <sub>2</sub> as well as the unique feature of hierarchical heterostructures are probably responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance.
