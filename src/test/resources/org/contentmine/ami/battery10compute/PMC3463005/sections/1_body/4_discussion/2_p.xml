<p>In summary, a simple, general yet effective strategy is developed based on the advantageously combination of the versatility of the electrospinning technique and hydrothermal growth to achieve various MOs, including Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and CuO, grown on pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers to form MO/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures. As potential anode materials for LIBs, the as-formed Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures exhibit high reversible capacity, improved cycling stability and rate capability with respect to the pristine TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. The improved electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the advantageous integration of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical nanostructure. The proposed synthesis strategy would open up new opportunities in the development of high performance next-generation LIBs used for alternative energy and electric transportation. Such hierarchical heterostructures might also be used in broad fields including photoelectrochemical water splitting and gas sensors.
