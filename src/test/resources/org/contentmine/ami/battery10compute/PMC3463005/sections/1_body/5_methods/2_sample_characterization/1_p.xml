<p>The morphology and crystalline structure of as-obtained samples were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) recorded on a Tecnai G2 operating at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku-Dmax 2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried on an ESCALAB MK X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Zeta potential was measured by dynamic light scattering (Malvern Nano-ZS). Raman measurements were performed at room temperature using an inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer with Raman shift from 100 to 1000 cm
