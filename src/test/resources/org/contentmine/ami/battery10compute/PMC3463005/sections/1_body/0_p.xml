<p>Growth of functional semiconductor oxides with controllable hierarchical heterostructures has attracted tremendous attention because diverse properties can be integrated by tailoring the morphology, composition, and assembling organization of the primary nanobuilding blocks. Specifically, novel hierarchical heterostructures, in which the major 1D cores and branches consist of different materials, are more attactive in many nanoscale photonic and electron-optical device applications. Especially, to serve as materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the hierarchical heterostructures not only integrate the diverse properties from the different building blocks, but also exhibit intriguing properties by taking advantage of both the nanometer-size effects and the high stability of the secondary-structure assemblies

 <sub>2</sub> nanowires, utilizing the better conductivity of SnO

Notwithstanding these advances, it is still of great challenge to develop a general approach with the characteristics of low cost, low growth temperature, environmental friendliness, process simplicity, and high yield to synthesize a control of size, dimension, and composition of the building blocks of hierarchical heterostructures in an expected manner.
