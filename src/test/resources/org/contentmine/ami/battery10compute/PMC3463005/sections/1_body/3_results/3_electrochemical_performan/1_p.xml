<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-based hierarchical nanofibers in improving the lithium storage performance, we take Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hierarchical heterostructures as a representative example and investigate the electrochemical properties of them as anode materials for LIBs, since Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> has high theoretical capacity (∼890 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and is widely considered to be an attractive anode material for next-generation LIBs.
