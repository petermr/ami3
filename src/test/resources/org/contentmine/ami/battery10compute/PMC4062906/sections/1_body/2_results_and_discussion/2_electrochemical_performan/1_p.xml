 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> presents the typical charge-discharge voltage curves of the anodes (compared to the full battery) constructed from MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials at 0.2 C rate in the voltage range of 0.01 to 3.60 V (vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). For clarity, only selected cycles are shown. As shown, the two α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials both have high initial discharge specific capacity as approximately 1,400 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, while the theoretical discharge specific capacity is 1,232 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The extra discharge specific capacities of the as-prepared MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials may result from the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer which is known as a gel-like layer, containing ethylene oxide-based oligomers, LiF, Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, and lithium alkyl carbonate (ROCO
 <sub>2</sub>Li), during the first discharging process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The discharge specific capacities of the as-prepared MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials in the second cycle are 500 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>(caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>) and 600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>), respectively. There is an attenuation compared to the initial discharge capacity. After the fifth cycling, the discharge specific capacities of the as-prepared MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are 356 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>) and 465 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>), respectively. In the repeated charge-discharge cycling, the discharge specific capacity eventually decays to about 250 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Here, the large capacity loss may come from two facts: one is the capacity loss from the incomplete decomposition of SEI film, which happens in all 3d transition metal oxides including CuO, NiO, and Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; the other one is capacity loss caused by the electrode pulverization and loss of inter-particle contact or the particle with copper foil collector due to large volume expansion/contraction during repeated charging-discharging processes and severe particle aggregation, which is common in all transition metal oxides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In fact, both the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials suffer from poor cycling stability of the discharge specific capacity. As usual, one effective way to mitigate the problem is to fabricate a hollow structure, as a hollow interior could provide extra free space for alleviating the structural strain and accommodating the large volume variation associated with repeated Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion insertion/extraction processes, giving rise to improved cycling stability. However, the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> in this research indeed has a hollow interior but poor cycling stability. So, another effective strategy to improve the cycling stability is the need for the as-prepared MnO
 <sub>2</sub> samples. For example, shell coating such as carbon coating, polypyrrole coating, and polyaniline coating is widely used to improve the cycling stability. Wan et al. prepared Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/porous carbon-multiwalled carbon nanotubes composite to promote cycle performance. Their excellent electrical properties can be attributed to the porous carbon framework structure, which provided space for the change in Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> volume during cycling and shortens the lithium ion diffusion distance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we are preparing polypyrrole coating MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials to enhance the cycling stability.
