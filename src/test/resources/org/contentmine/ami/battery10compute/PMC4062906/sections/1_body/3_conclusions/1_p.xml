<p>In summary, two MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials with urchin-like and caddice-clew-like morphologies are prepared by hydrothermal method. Both the crystalline phases are α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, which is essential to evaluate the relationship between electrochemical performances and morphologies of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals as anodes for lithium-ion battery application. Both the as-prepared α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> exhibit high initial specific capacity, but the discharge cycling stability is poor. Just in case of this research, the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material has better electrochemical performance. The results suggest that different morphologies indeed have influence on electrochemical performances of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials in the application of lithium-ion battery. This study also gives us advice to make shell coating on the as-prepared MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials to improve the cycling stability.
