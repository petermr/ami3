<p>The current intensity of oxidation peak is much lower than that of reduction peak. The current intensity of reduction peak and oxidation peak for the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material is 0.7828 and 0.1202 mA mg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The current intensity attenuation of oxidation peak indicates that Mn element could not completely convert to MnO
 <sub>2</sub> during the charging process. The shapes of the CV curves for the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> samples are similar, while urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material has higher peak intensity. The current intensity of reduction peak and oxidation peak for the caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material is 0.3333 and 0.0712 mA mg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The asymmetry cyclic voltammogram curves in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> indicate that the discharging/charging process is irreversible.
