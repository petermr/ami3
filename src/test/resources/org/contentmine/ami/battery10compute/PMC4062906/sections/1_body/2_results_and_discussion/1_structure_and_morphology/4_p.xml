<p>The XRD patterns of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. As shown, the two samples had similar crystallographic structure. The diffraction peaks which appeared at 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 12.7°, 18.1°, 28.8°, 37.5°, 42.1°, 49.9°, 56.2°, and 60.3° matched well with the diffraction peaks of (110),(200),(310),(211),(301),(411),(600), and (521) crystal planes of α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> standard data (JCPDS card PDF file no. 44-0141). Therefore, the two MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials prepared by hydrothermal method were both α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, which was essential to evaluate the relationship between electrochemical performances and morphologies of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals as anodes for lithium-ion battery. As calculated, the lattice parameters of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are 
 <italic>a</italic> = 9.7875 and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 2.8600, which are highly identical to the standard values (JCPDS card PDF file no. 44-0141, 
 <italic>a</italic> = 9.7847, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 2.863). The cell volume of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is 273.97 Å
 <sup>3</sup> which is also highly identical to the standard values (274.1 Å
 <sup>3</sup>),while the lattice parameters of urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are 
 <italic>a</italic> = 9.8084 and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 2.8483. According to the standard values, the crystal cell expands in a and b directions and contracts in c direction. The cell volume of urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is 274.02 Å
 <sup>3</sup>. The average size of the caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystal grains is calculated to be 32 nm according to the Scherrer equation 
 <italic>D</italic> = 
 <italic>Kλ</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic>cos
 <italic>θ</italic> using the strongest diffraction peak of (211) [
 <italic>D</italic> is crystal grain size (nm), 
 <italic>K</italic> is the Scherrer constant (0.89), 
 <italic>λ</italic> is the X-ray wavelength (0.154056 nm) for Cu Kα, 
 <italic>β</italic> is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak (211), and 
 <italic>θ</italic> is the angle of diffraction peak],while the measured diameter of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is 53 nm. The average size of the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystal grains is calculated to be 51 nm according to the Scherrer equation. The measured diameter of the short nanorods on urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is about 50 nm. As can be seen, the calculated crystallite size value of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystal is a little smaller than the measured value, but the calculated crystallite size value of urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystal is identical. Although the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are in micrometer scale, they are confirmed to assemble by nanomaterials. Consequently, although the two MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are with identical crystal structure, they may have some difference in the electrochemical performance as the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> has the expanded lattice parameters.
