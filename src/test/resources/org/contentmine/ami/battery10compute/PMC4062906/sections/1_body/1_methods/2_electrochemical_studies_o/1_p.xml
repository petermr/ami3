<p>Electrochemical performances of the samples were measured using CR2025 coin-type cells assembled in a dry argon-filled glove box. To fabricate the working electrode, a slurry consisting of 60 wt.% active materials, 10 wt.% acetylene black, and 30 wt.% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) dissolved in 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl pyrrolidinone was casted on a copper foil and dried at 80Â°C under vacuum for 5 h. Lithium sheet was served as counter and reference electrode, while a Celgard 2320 membrane (Shenzhen, China) was employed as a separator. The electrolyte was a solution of 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate (EC)-1,2-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 in volume). Galvanostatical charge-discharge experiments were performed by Land electric test system CT2001A (Wuhan LAND Electronics Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) at a current density of 0.2 C between 0.01 and 3.60 V (versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI604D, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) from 0.01 to 3.60 V (versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI604D, Chenhua, Shanghai, China), and the frequency ranged from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with an applied alternating current (AC) signal amplitude of 5 mV.
