<p>The parameters of impedance spectra were simulated by ZSimpWin software, and the spectra had been fitted with an equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. In the equivalent circuit of EIS, apart from the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>sf</sub>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub>, and 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>, the corresponding constant phase element (CPE) is used instead of pure capacitance due to the non-ideal nature of the electrode. The values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>sf</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub> calculated from the diameters of the high frequency and the high-to-medium frequency semicircles in the Nyquist plots for the electrodes are summarized in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub> for urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is 7.12Ω, while the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub> for caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is 8.05Ω. Theoretically, the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub> for both Li/MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cells should be the same as for the same electrolyte used here. The slight difference may be caused by the tiny difference in the battery package pressure by manual operation or the tiny difference in the amount of electrolyte added to the Li/MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cells by manual operation. Considering the tiny difference in manual operation, the small difference of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub> is acceptable since the ohmic electrolyte resistances of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are similar. The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>sf</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub> of the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are much lower than that of the caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. It proves that the Li-ion migration resistance through the SEI films and charge transfer resistance of the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are much lower than that of the caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. Here, the influence of the tiny difference in the battery package pressure and the amount of electrolyte on the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>sf</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub> can be neglected. So, the urchin-like morphology is more favorable for lithium ion diffusion and transfer, and the reaction of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials with lithium ion is much easier.
