<p>Urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial was prepared by the similar method, while after adding 1.70 g MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> · H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 2.72 g K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> into 35-mL distilled water, 2 mL H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was then added. Subsequently, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL), and the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 110°C for 6 h as well. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The solid black precipitate was filtered, washed several times with distilled water to remove impurities, and then dried at 80°C in air for 3 h.
