<p>All reagents purchased from the Shanghai Chemical Company (Shanghai, China) were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials were prepared using the similar method described by Yu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] with some modifications. To prepare caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial, 1.70 g MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> · H
 <sub>2</sub>O was dissolved in 15-mL distilled water with vigorous stirring. When the solution was clear, 20-mL aqueous solution containing 2.72 g K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> was added to the above solution under continuous stirring. Then, the resulting transparent solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) of 80% capacity of the total volume. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 110°C for 6 h. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The solid black precipitate was filtered, washed several times with distilled water to remove impurities, and then dried at 80°C in air for 3 h. The obtained caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial was collected for the following characterization.
