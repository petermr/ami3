<p>The crystallographic structures of the products were determined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) which were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2200/PC (Rigaku, Beijing, China) with Cu target at a scanning rate of 7°/min with 2
 <italic>θ</italic> ranging from 10° to 70°. The morphological investigations of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Zeiss Ultra, Oberkochen, Germany).
