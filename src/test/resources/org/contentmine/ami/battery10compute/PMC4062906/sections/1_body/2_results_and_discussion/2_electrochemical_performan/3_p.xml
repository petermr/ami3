<p>The cyclic voltammogram curves were tested to further investigate the electrochemical performances of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials, as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. In the CV curves, there is only a pair of redox peaks, indicating the one-step intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ion during the charging and discharging process. The reduction peak is at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well with flat discharge plateau in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. In this process, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is transformed to Mn, and Li
 <sup>+</sup> is inserted into the anode to format Li
 <sub>2</sub>O. The reaction is as follows:
