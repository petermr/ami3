<p>Compared to the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], when MnO
 <sub>2</sub> materials were used for electrochemical supercapacitors, caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material had higher specific capacitance of 120 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> and lower charge-transfer resistance, while the specific capacitance of urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material was about 48 F g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, they found the unique capacitance of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> was mainly due to the incompact structure. Therefore, the relationship between electrochemical performance and morphology is different when MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material is used as electrochemical supercapacitor or as anode of lithium-ion battery. For the application on lithium-ion battery, urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> material is better.
