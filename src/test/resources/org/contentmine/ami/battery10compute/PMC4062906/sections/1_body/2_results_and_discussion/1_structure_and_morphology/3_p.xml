<p>As can be seen in Reaction (1), the reaction rate is pH dependent. Therefore, sulfuric acid is added to decrease the reaction rate, and the morphology can be modulated. When no sulfuric acid is used, these primary nanoparticles form quickly (shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>(a)). Then, the tiny nanoparticles spontaneously aggregate into long nanowires. With minimizing interfacial energies, the nanowires wrap with each other incompactly to form caddice-clew-shaped MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials. When sulfuric acid is added as morphology modulation agent, the nucleation process in Reaction (1) is suppressed. In this situation, it is not easy to form nanowires. Alternatively, short nanorods are formed (shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>(b)). With minimizing interfacial energies, the nanorods self-assemble compactly to urchin morphology with a hollow interior. Thus, urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are prepared. Therefore, sulfuric acid plays a crucial role in the morphology evolution due to its control of the nucleation rate of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>.
