<p>In addition, a discharge plateau with wide and flat shape appears in all the discharge voltage curves. Urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial has a plateau at about 0.32 V from 120 to 1,100 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> during the first discharging process and has a plateau from 50 to 360 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the second cycling. The caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial has similar discharge plateau. The discharge plateau may bring stable discharge current to the battery prepared by MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials. According to the results of discharge specific capacity, urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial was better than caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial.
