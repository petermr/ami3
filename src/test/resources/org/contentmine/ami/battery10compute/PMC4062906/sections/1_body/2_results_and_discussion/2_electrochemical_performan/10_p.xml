<p>In order to gain further understanding of the differences in the electrochemical performances, EIS testing was carried out. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> presents the EIS results for lithium cells after the fifth cycle at open circuit voltage. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>(a), the impedance spectra of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> consist of two oblate semicircles in high-to-medium frequency region and an inclined line in low-frequency region, while the two semicircles of urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are not easily distinguishable. The impedance spectra reflect several processes that take place in a series: Li migration through surface films, charge transfer, solid-state diffusion, and finally, accumulation of Li in the bulk of the active mass. An intercept at the 
 <italic>Z</italic>
 <sub>real</sub> axis in high-frequency region corresponds to the ohmic electrolyte resistance (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>). The first semicircle in the high frequency ascribes to the Li-ion migration resistance (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>sf</sub>) through the SEI films. The second semicircle in the high-to-medium frequency ascribes to the charge transfer resistance (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub>). The inclined line at low-frequency region represents the Warburg impedance (
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>), which is associated with lithium-ion diffusion in the active material [
