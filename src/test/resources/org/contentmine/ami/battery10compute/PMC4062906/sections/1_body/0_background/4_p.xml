<p>In the present work, to enrich the relationship between electrochemical performances and morphologies, two α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals with caddice-clew-like and urchin-like morphologies were prepared by hydrothermal method. For lithium-ion battery application, urchin-like α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystal with compact structure was found to have better electrochemical performance.
