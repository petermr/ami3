<p>Manganese dioxides with diverse crystal morphologies are attracting a lot of attention because of their physical and chemical properties and wide applications in catalysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], biosensors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], water treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], electrochemical supercapacitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and so on. Up to now, various MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals with different morphologies such as nanosphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], nanorod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], nanowire [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], nanoflower [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], nanotube [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], pillow-shape [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], urchin-like [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], hollow nanosphere, hollow nanocube [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and hollow cone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have been synthesized. MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals were already used in water treatment, gas sensors, electrochemical supercapacitors, and so on. For example, hollow spherical and cubic MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures prepared by Kirkendall effect showed good ability to remove organic pollutants in waste water [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Cao et al. had prepared pillow-shaped MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals which could remove about 85% of the Cd
 <sup>2+</sup> in waste water [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Zhang et al. had prepared MnO
 <sub>2</sub> hollow nanospheres and nanowires used for ammonia gas sensor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. MnO
 <sub>2</sub> hollow nanospheres were found to exhibit enhanced sensing performance to ammonia gas at room temperature compared with MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires. Ma et al. had prepared urchin-shaped MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and clew-like-shaped MnO
 <sub>2</sub> used for electrochemical supercapacitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They found the electrochemical performances differed with various morphologies, and clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanospheres had higher capacitance and lower charge-transfer resistance due to their incompact structure. However, the application researches of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> as anode for lithium-ion battery were relatively few.
