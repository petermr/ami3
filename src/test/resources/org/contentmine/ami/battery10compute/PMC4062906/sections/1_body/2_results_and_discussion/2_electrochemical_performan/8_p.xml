<p>To exclude the influence of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial density on the electrode, we have normalized the CV curve in FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. According to the results of galvanostatical charge-discharge experiments and CV tests, the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial is more superior than caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial. We presume the difference on electrochemical performance results from the morphology as both the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials have identical crystalline phase. Theoretically, nanomaterials with incompact structure are beneficial to improve the transmission rate and transfer ability of lithium ion. However, the discharge cycling stability of caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial is poor. We guess the incompact structure may lead to easy electrode pulverization and loss of inter-particle contact during the repeated charging-discharging processes. A hollow structure which is another effective strategy to improve the cycling stability could provide extra free space for alleviating the structural strain and accommodating the large volume variation associated with repeated Li
 <sup>+</sup> insertion/extraction processes. So, the relatively better discharge cycling stability may result from the hollow structure. In addition, the surface of urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is an arrangement of compact needle-like nanorods, which could improve the transmission rate and transfer ability of lithium ion. Therefore, the electrochemical performances of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials indeed have relationship on their morphologies. The results suggest that the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial is more promising for the anode of lithium-ion battery.
