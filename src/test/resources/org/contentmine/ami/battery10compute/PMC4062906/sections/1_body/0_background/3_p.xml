<p>The research on MnO
 <sub>2</sub> anode is relatively complex because MnO
 <sub>2</sub> exists in several crystallographic forms such as α-, β-, γ-, and δ-type. For example, Zhao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals with hollow interior had high discharge capacity as 602.1 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 20 cycles. Li et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> with nanotube morphology exhibited high reversible capacity of 512 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a high current density of 800 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 300 cycles. Thus, from the above two examples, we could summarize that the electrochemical performance of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals has relationship both with the crystallographic forms and with the morphologies. Therefore, the researches on the relationship of electrochemical performance with the morphologies and the relationship of electrochemical performance with the crystallographic forms are very essential.
