 <sub>2</sub> nanomaterials are recognized as anode materials since three-dimensional (3d) transition metal oxides (MO, where M is Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) were proposed to serve as high theoretic capacity anodes for lithium-ion battery by Poizot et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Before that, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanomaterials were usually used to prepare LiMn

 <sub>4</sub> crystals as cathode for lithium-ion battery [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Chen's research group has made great contributions on the research of anode for lithium-ion battery [

 <sub>2</sub> nanomaterials on anodes for lithium-ion battery is still immature, although the investigations on their preparation are plentiful.
