<p>The SEM images of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are displayed in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The SEM study in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a indicates that the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> prepared under the neutral reaction conditions is a nanowire 55 to 83 nm in diameter and several micrometers in length for average. Moreover, these nanowires aggregate into spherical shape with diameter of about 2 to 4 μm, and the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials are like a caddice clew. To mention the sample easily, we call this MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial as caddice-clew-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b, when sulfuric acid was added as morphology modulation agent, the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterial has a uniform sea-urchin-like shape with diameter of approximately 3 μm, which consists of several straight and radially grown nanorods with uniform length of about 1 μm. As indicated by the arrow in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b, the urchin-like MnO
 <sub>2</sub> microsphere has a hollow interior. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> illustrates the possible formation processes for the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials. During the preparation of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> micromaterials, the K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> plays the role to oxidate the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion to MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. Firstly, the tiny crystalline nuclei of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are generated from Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> by the oxidation in the supersaturated solution and grow into nanoparticles. The nucleation process could be regarded as
