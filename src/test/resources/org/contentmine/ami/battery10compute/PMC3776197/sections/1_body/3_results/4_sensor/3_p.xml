<p>The MnO@C nanocomposite is further used for electrochemical detection of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> produced by living cells, including human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (a normal cell line) and HeLa cells. A low concentration (1 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) of phobol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) is added to the cell culture for a short period of time (30–60 s), which can induce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> generation from tumor cells
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and then a small amount of the cell culture solution containing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is added to the electrochemical detection assay (Methods). For the 293T cells (~10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL), the MnO@C nanocomposite electrode does not show an observable amperometric response before and after the addition of PMA. Under otherwise identical conditions, a substantial larger signal is observed from the MnO@C nanocomposite electrode for HeLa cells (~10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) incubated with PMA. Furthermore, the introduction of a catalase into the HeLa cell culture medium reduces the current change to the background level. As catalase is known to selectively decompose H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, this result indicates that the current increase of the MnO@C nanocomposite electrode is attributed to the formation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by the cellular process. Moreover, the higher signal from HeLa cells suggests a more active cellular activity than that of the 293T normal cells, in good accord with previous reports
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. These results suggest the potential use of the highly sensitive MnO@C nanocomposite electrode for detection of cellular functions.
