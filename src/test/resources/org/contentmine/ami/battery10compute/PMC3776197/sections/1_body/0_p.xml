<p>Manganese oxides (MnO
 <sub>x</sub>) are a class of transition metal oxides, including MnO, MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, Mn
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, which are endowed with rich oxidation states and chemistry

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The electron transfer of MnO
 <sub>x</sub> structures, along with the fast development of versatile structures controlled during the growth, has offered substantial potentials in many application fields, including catalysis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, chemical/biological sensing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and energy storage
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Manganese oxides are promising candidates for active electrode materials, due to their high specific capacitance, low cost, abundance and environmentally benign nature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. For instance, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MnO have high theoretical capacities of ~1232 and 755 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> as lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes, respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. For supercapacitors, the nanostructured manganese oxides have presented great capacitance retention upon cycling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Nonetheless, these performances are still limited due to, in general, the low electrical conductivity, low rate capability, and suboptimal structural stability of MnO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, have been explored to improve the performance of MnO
 <sub>x</sub>-based electrodes. For instance, Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported a solution approach of growing Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide sheets, with a high specific capacity up to ~900 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> as LIB anodes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Mallouk and coworkers developed a template-free hydrothermal synthesis of graphene/Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanorod composites from KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> and ethylene glycol, which showed an enhanced capacitance and long cycle stability over free Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanorods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Jiang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported a sol-gel method for the growth of MnO
 <sub>x</sub> nanoparticle/mesoporous carbon/MnO
 <sub>x</sub> hybrid nanowires, where a high specific capacitance of 266 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> was obtained
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In addition to the solution methods, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has also been used to deposit carbon coating on the surface of porous MnO microspheres, which are obtained by decomposing Mn precursors such as MnCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. For biosensing, one well-known example is that MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is good catalyst for decomposition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which is an important intermediate or product of many biochemical reactions and has a well-established relationship with numerous biological processes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The detection of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has been demonstrated previously with MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, which waives the need of electrode modification with enzymes. Recently, a sensitive detection of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was reported by a MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphene oxide nanocomposite, with a low detection limit of 0.8 μM
