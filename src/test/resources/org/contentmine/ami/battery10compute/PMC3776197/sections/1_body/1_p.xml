<p>In spite of these research progresses, several main challenges still need to be addressed for optimizing the conductance and rate performance of MnO
 <sub>x</sub>-based electrodes. For the direct growth of conducting carbon nanostructures including carbon nanotubes and graphene by CVD, the requirement of high reaction temperatures precludes the use of a majority of substrates, especially flexible substrates. In addition, the loading density of MnO
 <sub>x</sub>@C composites with MnO
 <sub>x</sub> directly grown on conducting substrates is usually restricted, due to the ultrathin film of the MnO
 <sub>x</sub> backbones
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. On the other hand, when the pre-formed MnO
 <sub>x</sub>@C nanostructures is coated on a current collector, it often needs adding auxiliary binders and/or conductive reagents, such as conducting polymer
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and acetylene black
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, which takes additional fabrication steps and cost, as well as reduces the effective mass percentage of electroactive materials. Furthermore, the lack of nanoscale pores that can allow for efficient mass transport towards and from the active MnO
 <sub>x</sub> sites also limits their rate capability for energy storage, as well as sensitive molecular detection. Recently, an 
 <italic>in situ</italic> method based on a free-radical polymerization in the presence of metal oxide precursors was reported to produce a cross-linked polymer network incorporated with Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> or MnO nanoparticles (NPs), which can be thermally converted into uniform NP@C nanocomposites for LIB application
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. However, this approach is still constrained by the use of conducting polymer as a binder and structural directing agent, and the obtained reversible capacity of the MnO@C nanocomposite is still far from the theoretical values.
