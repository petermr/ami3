<p>Cells were cultured in 10 ml of DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin GIBCOBRL (Grand Island, New York, USA), at 37°C in a humidified hood filled with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After reaching 80–90% confluence, the cells were adjusted in PBS for 2 h prior to the sensing experiment. For the cell number counting, the cells were lifted with trypsin-EDTA and then re-dispersed in DMEM (high glucose) medium. The cell number was counted using a hemocytometer.
