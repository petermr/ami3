<p>The MnO@C nanocomposite is synthesized by a modified method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, in which a Mn-oleate precursor solution is directly coated on a conducting substrate, followed by thermal calcination at 550°C in Ar (Methods). After the solution coating, the substrate surface is covered by a uniform layer of brown color waxy solid, which turns black after thermal treatment. This process can be applied to a large variety of substrates, including Ni foam, Ti foil, carbon fiber, silicon wafer, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, and so on (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1</xref>), indicating the general availability of this two-step coating-conversion method. The film thickness resulted from a single coating is ~300 nm (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2a</xref>), corresponding to a net mass per area of ~1.24 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2b</xref>). Repeated coating of the Mn-oleate precursor solution on the substrate leads to an almost linear increase of the film mass with the coating times. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the substrate is covered with a film of multi-layered, hexagonally closed-packed spherical NP arrays, with a uniform size distribution of ~10 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). Random, short cracks are observed over the film surface between different NP domains, which may result from the volume contraction of the nanocomposite during thermal treatment. Nonetheless, most of the NPs are still closed packed and the majority of the film is continuous. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images exhibit that these monodispersed NPs are embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix, in which each NP is coated by the carbon layer without being aggregated with adjacent ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c</xref>). The average diameter of the NPs is 10 ± 2 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images reveal that each NP is single crystalline with few observable structure defects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref>). Well-resolved lattice fringes are observed from these nearly spherical NPs, which correspond to 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing values of 0.25 and 0.22 nm, consistent with the (111) and (200) planes reported for single crystal MnO
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The select area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows a poly-crystalline diffraction pattern, due to the different orientation from various MnO NPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref>, inset). The first three diffraction rings of the SAED pattern correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) lattice planes.
