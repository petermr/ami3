<p>In addition to high specific capacitance, the cycle stability is further tested to demonstrate its potential for long-term use. The charge-discharge cycles of the MnO@C nanocomposite at a current density of 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> exhibits repeated, almost identical triangular curve shapes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4d</xref>). The long-term stability is demonstrated by the specific capacitance as a functional of cycle numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4e</xref>). After 2500 cycles, the specific capacitance is retained at ~160 F g
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to ~110% of its original value. The slight increase of capacitance is ascribed to the activation effect of electrochemical cycling, suggested by previous reports of other manganese oxide-based electrode materials
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This cycling performance is better than previous reports of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based composites, such as graphene oxide-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, which show over 84% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. A main reason of the capacitance loss for manganese oxide-based supercapacitor is the dissolution of active materials into electrolyte solution during cycling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, in our experiment, the electrolyte remains transparent after the cycling test, indicating that the majority of the MnO is stable and not dissolved. Moreover, the mechanical stability of the MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foam is demonstrated by measuring of electrochemical performance after repeated folding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4f</xref>). The specific capacitance is retained almost constant (&gt;96%), even after being folded with an angle of almost 180° for 70 times. These results suggest that the direct growth of MnO@C nanocomposite on substrates present remarkable electrochemical and mechanical stability.
