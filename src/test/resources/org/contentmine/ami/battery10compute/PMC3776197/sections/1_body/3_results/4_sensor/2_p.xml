<p>In our experiment, the CV of the MnO@C nanocomposite grown on a Ti substrate is first measured, in the presence of 0.4 and 2 mM of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in a phosphate buffer solution, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref>). Compared with the CV curve measured without H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, a substantial increase of the current density is observed, indicating the increase charge transfer upon the addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. In order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the subsequent time-dependent current measurement, the bias range is selected as 0.6–0.7 V, where the current baseline of MnO@C nanocomposite without H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is close to zero and the current increase with the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> addition is relatively large (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5</xref>). The response of the MnO@C nanocomposite to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is then interrogated by the time-dependent current measurement, with successive injection of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at intervals under a bias of 0.65 V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref>). Upon each addition of 200 μM of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, the MnO@C nanocomposite electrode responds quickly with a conductance increase, which reaches equilibrium within 5–10 s. The magnitude of current increase for the subsequent H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> injections is smaller than that for the first several H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> injections, suggesting the signal saturation at higher H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations. Interestingly, when the free-standing MnO@C nanocomposite is coated on a Ti substrate, a much less response to the same H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> injection is recorded, which also shows earlier saturation upon the successive addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, suggesting the importance of direct growth/attachment of MnO@C nanocomposite on the conducting substrate. The conductance change with different H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations (2, 10, 20, 100, 200 and 1000 μM) and the corresponding calibration curves are exhibited in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S6 and 5c</xref>, respectively. A wide linear range of 2 μM–2.4 mM is obtained, with the lowest H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration detected as ~2 μM. These values are comparable or superior to most of the enzymatic or non-enzymatic manganese oxide-based H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> sensors
