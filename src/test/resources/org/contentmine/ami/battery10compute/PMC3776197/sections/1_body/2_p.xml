<p>In this paper, we demonstrate a facile method for direct coating of MnO organic precursor solution onto substrates without conducting polymer binders, followed by thermal treatment to grow monodispersed, ~10 nm-diameter MnO NPs embedded in a mesoporous carbon matrix (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). This MnO@C nanocomposite allows for efficient charge transfer, in which the carbon matrix serves as the major pathways for enhanced charge transport from MnO NPs. In addition, the mesopores of the carbon matrix offer efficient mass transport for electrolyte solution and chemical species, while at the same time providing volume buffer for MnO NPs during lithiation/delithiation, thus leading to excellent rate capabilities and cycling stability of this MnO@C nanocomposite. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to a large variety of substrates, including flexible ones for potential applications in portable energy storage and sensing devices. As proofs-of-concept, LIB anodes made of this monodispersed MnO@C nanocomposite display excellent reversible capacities of over 800 and 520 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at current densities of 0.1 and 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Supercapacitors made of this MnO@C nanocomposite exhibit stable capacitances of 160 and 40 F g
 <sup>−1</sup>, at current densities of 1 and 40 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which also show excellent mechanical stability over repeated folding and stretching. Finally, this MnO@C nanocomposite demonstrates sensitive electrical response to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in buffer solutions, and has been applied to interrogate the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration in cellular assays for tumor cell analysis.
