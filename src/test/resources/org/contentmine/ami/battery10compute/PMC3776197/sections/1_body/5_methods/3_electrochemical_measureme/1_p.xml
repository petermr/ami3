<p>The mass loadings of the actual samples for lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor tests were in the range of 1.6 ± 0.2 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. For lithium-ion battery measurement, the MnO/C nanocomposite electrodes were galvanostatically cycled on a galvanostat over a voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li. Cyclic voltamograms (CVs) were recorded on a potentiostat over a voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li at a scan rate of 0.5 mV/s. In rate capability test, the lithiation and delithiation current densities were changed every five cycles, according to this sequence of values: 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 100 mA g
