<p>The Mn-oleate precursor was prepared by a simple chemical reaction of MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> and sodium oleate, modified from a previous report
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In brief, 0.80 g of MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O (~2 mmol) and 2.44 g of sodium oleate (~4 mmol) were first dissolved in a mixture of H
 <sub>2</sub>O (6 mL), ethanol (8 mL) and hexane (14 mL), with continuous stirring at room temperature for 30 min. The color of the upper solution gradually changed to light brown. The resultant mixture was kept still and aged at 70°C in an oven for 4 h. Afterwards, the upper solution (organic phase) was collected, and washed with deionized (DI) water for several times to obtain the Mn-oleate/hexane solution. To prepare for the MnO@C nanocomposite, a conductive substrate (such as Ni foam or Ti foil) was dipped into the Mn-oleate/hexane solution for several seconds. After the solvent was evaporated at room temperature, the substrate was coated with a red-brown waxy solid. This step can be repeated for several times to increase the loading amount of the Mn-oleate precursor. The substrate was then heated to 550°C at 10°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> under Ar atmosphere, and then kept for 2 h before cooling to room temperature.
