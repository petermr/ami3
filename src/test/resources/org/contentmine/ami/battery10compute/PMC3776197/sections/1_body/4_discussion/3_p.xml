<p>In summary, we have demonstrated a facile, two-step coating/calcination method to synthesize a MnO@C nanocomposite, by directly coating of the Mn-oleate precursor solution on arbitrary conducting substrates, such as Ni foam and Ti foil, followed by calcination to convert the organic precursor molecules into a matrix of MnO NPs and mesoporous carbon. The monodispersed, sub-10 nm-diameter MnO NPs serve as the main sites of the electrochemical reaction, and the carbon matrix provides an efficient charge transport pathway from MnO NPs to the underlying substrate. In addition, the mesopores inside the carbon matrix also lead to fast mass transport of molecules and ions towards the MnO NP surface, as well as the structural spacer for the volume change during the lithiation/delithiation or mechanical deformation. This MnO@C nanocomposite has exhibited excellent performance for electrochemical energy storage and sensing. The LIB anodes made of the MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foam show a high reversible capacity of ~800 and ~520 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, at 0.1 and 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The supercapacitor electrodes made of the MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foam present an electrochemical capacitance of 160 and 41 F g
 <sup>−1</sup>, at 1 and 40 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The electrochemical sensors based on the MnO@C nanocomposite on Ti foil show a wide, linear response regime for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, with detection limit as low as 2 μM. In addition, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> produced by HeLa cells can be well detected, clearly distinguished from that obtained from normal cell lines. Moreover, this synthesis approach is facile and convenient, and can be applied for other transition metal oxide NP@mesoporous C nanocomposite on a variety of substrates, thus opening up substantial opportunities for many promising electrochemical applications.
