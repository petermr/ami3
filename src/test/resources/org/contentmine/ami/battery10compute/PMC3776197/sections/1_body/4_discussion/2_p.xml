<p>To confirm the enhanced charge transport by the carbon coating, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is carried out for the MnO@C nanocomposite directly grown on Ni foam and fabricated as LIB anodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref>), compared to that of the coating of pre-synthesized MnO@C nanocomposite on identical Ni foam substrates. The Nyquist plots are recorded at a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz at an amplitude of 10 mV. The MnO@C nanocomposite grown on Ni foam exhibits a much smaller diameter of the depressed semicircle, indicating a much more efficient charge transfer process at the electrode interface

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, the charge transfer resistance for the direct growth and the post-coating approach are ~123.3 and ~204.8 Ω, respectively. Similarly, for the MnO@C nanocomposite fabricated as supercapacitor electrodes, the direct growth method provides a much smaller diameter of the Nyquist plot than that of the conventional post coating method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6b</xref>). The equivalent circuit modeling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> yields the charge transfer resistances of ~1.2 and ~1.8 Ω, respectively. Moreover, when the MnO@C nanocomposite is calcined to remove the carbon matrix, the Nyquist plot shows a substantially increased diameter of the semicircle, corresponding to a charge transfer resistance of 709.5 Ω. This result suggests that the removal of the carbon coating leads to a much increased electrical impedance and a reduced charge transfer process.
