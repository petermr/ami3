<p>For the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> sensing, the MnO/C nanocomposite electrodes were galvanostatically cycled on a galvanostat over a voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The time-dependent conductivity test was carried out in a 5 mL of PBS solution at a bias voltage of 0.6–0.7 V, with addition of different concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in PBS. For the cellular measurement, both HEK 293T cells and HeLa cells were incubated with 1 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 30 s. For the catalase inhibition, 1 mL of a catalase solution (350 unit mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added into the cell culture for 30 min, before the addition of PMA. The measurement of the MnO@C nanocomposite was carried out in the same solution as the cell culture medium. Then 100 μL of the cell culture was injected into the detection solution (5 mL) for the conductivity measurement.
