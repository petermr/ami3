<p>In addition to LIB anodes, the potential of using the MnO@C nanocomposite directly grown on a conducting substrate as electrochemical capacitors is subsequently evaluated. The MnO@C nanocomposite grown on a Ni foam substrate is fabricated as the working electrode, with a Pt wire serving as the counter electrode. A Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution is used as the electrolyte, and a voltage range between 0 and 1 V is applied. The CV curves under different scanning rates, including 25, 100, and 250 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, show nearly rectangular feature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>), indicating a close-to-ideal pseudocapacitive nature of the electrode. At a high scanning rate of 500 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, the CV curve presents some deviation of a rectangular shape, which can be ascribed to the inherent resistivity of the electrode
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The MnO@C nanocomposite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 120 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a scan rate of 25 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, which decreases to 53 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a high scan rate of 500 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>.
