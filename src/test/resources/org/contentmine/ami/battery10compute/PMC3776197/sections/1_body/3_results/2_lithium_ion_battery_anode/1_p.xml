<p>The electrochemical storage capacity of the obtained MnO@C nanocomposites is first investigated for LIB anodes, where the precursor solution is directly coated on a Ni foam substrate before thermal treatment, without adding any conducting polymers or binders. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests are first carried out to characterize the electrochemical reaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref>). In the reduction half cycle, the main cathodic peak close to 0.1 V is observed during the first cycle, corresponding to the reduction of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> to Mn
 <sup>0</sup> and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the nanocomposite surface

 <sub>2</sub>O and metallic Mn, presented as
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>: MnO + 2 Li → Mn
 <sup>0</sup> + Li
 <sub>2</sub>O. In the oxidation half cycle, the main peak is exhibited at ~1.4 V, in good accord with the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>0</sup> to Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> in previous reports
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Both the reduction and oxidation curves almost overlap with the subsequent ones since the second cycle, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility of the MnO@C nanocomposite.
