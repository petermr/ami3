<p>The direct growth method for the MnO@C nanocomposite provides a facile and efficient means of synthesizing mono-dispersed, ~10-nm-diameter MnO NPs embedded in mesoporous carbon coating, which is directly attached to the conducting substrate (current collector) for efficient charge transport. In addition, the loading amount can be conveniently controlled by repeated coating of the Mn-oleate precursor solution on the substrate, followed by a single calcination step to convert to the MnO@C nanocomposite. The excellent performances of the MnO@C nanocomposite as LIB anodes, supercapacitors, and chemical sensors are attributed to the following advantages. First, the mesopores in the carbon matrix facilitates fast transport of molecules and ions from the electrolyte solution to the MnO NP surface. Second, the monodispersed, ultra-small MnO NPs and the surrounding mesoporous carbon matrix provide a high surface area for electrochemical reactions, which can sufficiently utilize the active materials. Third, the carbon matrix offers an efficient charge transport pathway from the MnO NPs to the supporting substrate, where the direct growth of the MnO@C nanocomposite on the conducting substrate surface allows for low contact resistance and enhanced charge transfer. Finally, the carbon matrix coating prevents the MnO NPs from degradation, while at the same time, the mesopores also serve as structural buffers for the dramatic volume change during Li
