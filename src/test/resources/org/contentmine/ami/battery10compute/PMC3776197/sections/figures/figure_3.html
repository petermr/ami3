 <caption> LIB measurement of MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foam. (a) Cyclic voltammograms for the first 3 cycles. (b) Voltage profiles at a current density of 100 mA g −1 for the 1 st, 2 nd, 50 th and 80 th discharge/charge cycles. (c) Cycling performances of directly growth (red curve) and post-coating (black curve) of MnO@C nanocomposite on Ni foams. The Coulombic efficiency of the direct growth method is also displayed (green curve). (d) Capacity retention at different charge/discharge rates from 0.1–2 A g −1. </caption>
