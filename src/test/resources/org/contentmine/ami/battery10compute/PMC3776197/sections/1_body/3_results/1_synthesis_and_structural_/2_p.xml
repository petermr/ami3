<p>The structure and phase purity of this MnO@C nanocomposite grown on Ni foam is further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which displays well-resolved diffraction peaks at 34.9°, 40.5°, 58.7°, 70.2°, 73.8° (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2e</xref>). These peaks are well indexed as the 111, 200, 220, 311, and 222 reflections of MnO (JCPDS Card no. 07-0230), in good accord with the HRTEM and SAED results. No additional peaks other than the Ni foam are observed (

 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S4</xref>), attributed to the G-band and D-band of carbon, indicating the existence of both sp
 <sup>2</sup> and sp
 <sup>3</sup> carbons, respectively. The amount of MnO in the nanocomposite is quantified as ~84.3%, measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Furthermore, the N
 <sub>2</sub> sorption isotherm of the MnO@C nanocomposite shows a typical type-IV curve and a distinct condensation step (

 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is comparable to MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures produced under similar temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The pore size derived from the adsorption branch shows a relatively narrow distribution of 5–40 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2f</xref>, inset). The surface area and large pore size are beneficial for providing sufficient interface between the electroactive materials and the electrolyte.
