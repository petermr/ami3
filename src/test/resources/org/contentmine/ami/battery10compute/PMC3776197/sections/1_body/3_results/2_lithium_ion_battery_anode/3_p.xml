<p>To further demonstrate the advantage of direct growth on substrate, MnO@C nanocomposite grown as free-standing power form, but otherwise identical conditions, is coated on Ni foam substrates with binding and conducting additives, and tested as LIB anodes for comparison (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref>, black curve). The galvanostatic measurements at same 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> current density shows an initial discharge capacity of 981 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which rapidly drops to 395.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at the second cycle and is retained at ~177.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 80 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 45% compared to that of the second cycle. This comparison clearly indicates that the direct growth of MnO@C nanocomposite over the current collector substantially enhances the Li
 <sup>+</sup> storage capacity as LIB anodes. Moreover, the cycling performance of the MnO@C nanocomposite anode is further interrogated, where each step consists of 5 discharge/charge cycles at different current densities in the range of 0.1–2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3d</xref>). The discharge capacities are retained at 900, 780, 700, 610 and 520 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, with a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% for each cycle. This much enhanced capacity especially at high current rates is contributed to the efficient ion transport through the mesopores in the carbon matrix towards the MnO NP surface, as well as rapid charge transfer to the Ni foam substrate. When the current density is reset to 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the capacity is recovered to 850 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, suggesting excellent cycling performance and stability of the MnO@C nanocomposite.
