<p>The electrochemical performance of the MnO@C nanocomposite is further evaluated by galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement carried out at different current densities. The charging and discharging curves of several representative current rates, 0.5, 1, 2, and 8 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, are exhibited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref>). All these curves present a symmetrical feature between the charging and discharging branches, suggesting ideal pseudocapacitive nature of fast charge/discharge processes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. At 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, a high specific capacitance of 160 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained, comparable to most of the manganese oxide-based composite materials reported recently, such as MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/CNT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (179 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>), MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/carbon microfiber/CNT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (180 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>), MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphene oxide nanocomposites
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> (111 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanorod/graphene
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (115 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>). The rate capability is further examined by measuring the charge/discharge cycles at higher current densities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref>). The specific capacitance shows a decrease trend with the increase of current density, due to the diffusion-limited charge/discharge process as well as the electrode overpotential at high current densities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, while it still maintains good capacitance retention. The specific capacitances at 8 and 40 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> are 101.6 and 41.2 F g
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to 63.5% and 25.8% of the value obtained at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, suggesting attractive rate capabilities for potential high power applications. Our result is comparable or better than most of the manganese oxide-based composite materials reported in similar high current densities, such as MnO
 <sub>2</sub> coaxially coated on aligned carbon nanofiber arrays
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> (70 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 15 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanorod/graphene sheet composites
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (88 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Another recent report of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> NW/mesoporous carbon/MnO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> presents a high specific capacitance of 150 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 60 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, while this approach requires separate growth and coating steps for each structural component. In comparison, our synthesis approach has only a single coating and calcination step, which is much more convenient and readily to scale up.
