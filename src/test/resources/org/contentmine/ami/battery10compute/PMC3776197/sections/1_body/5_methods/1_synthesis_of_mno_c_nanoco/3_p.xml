<p>The MnO percentage in the nanocomposite was determined by ICP, briefly described as follows: an as-made MnO@C nanocomposite sample was mixed with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (1â€…M) to fully dissolve the MnO content, and the supernatant was collected and measured by ICP, which showed the concentration of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>. In addition, no other metal ions were detected by ICP, suggesting the purity of our samples. The mass percentage of MnO was then calculated based on the measured Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration and the original sample mass.
