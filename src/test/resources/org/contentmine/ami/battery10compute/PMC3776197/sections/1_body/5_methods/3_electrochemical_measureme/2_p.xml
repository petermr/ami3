<p>For supercapacitor measurement, the electrochemical measurements were conducted using a three-electrode mode in a 0.5 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution. The working electrodes were prepared by directly grow on MnO@C nanocomposites on a Ni foam (1.2 cm in diameter), followed by pressing the substrate onto another Ni foam with larger size (2 cm × 5 cm). The reference electrode and counter electrode were Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt wire, respectively. Typical CV curves were measured between 0.01 and 1 V.
