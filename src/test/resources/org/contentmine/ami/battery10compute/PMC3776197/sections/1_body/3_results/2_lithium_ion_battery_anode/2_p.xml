<p>Galvanostatic measurements of discharge-charge cycles are further carried out in the MnO@C nanocomposite based on the half-cell configuration at a current density of 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, where several representative cycles, including the 1
 <sup>st</sup>, 2
 <sup>nd</sup>, 50
 <sup>th</sup>, and 100
 <sup>th</sup> ones, are displayed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref>). The voltage drops rapidly to ~0.5 V in the first discharge cycle, followed by two voltage plateaus at 0.5 and 0.3 V. The discharge profile is shifted to 0.6 V since the second cycle. For the charging process, two small voltage plateaus at 1.2 and 2.0 V are observed for all the charging cycles, in good accord with the CV measurement. An ultrahigh capacity of 1542 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> is recorded for the first discharge process, which decreases to 981 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at the first charge process, indicating an initial Coulombic efficiency of 64%. These initial capacities exceed the theoretical value of MnO, which can be ascribed to the decomposition of electrolyte to form the SEI layer and further lithium storage via interfacial charging at metal Li
 <sub>2</sub>O interface

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref>, red curve). The discharge capacity becomes much more stable since the second cycle, with the Coulombic efficiency of each cycle over 95%. After 80 cycles, the discharge capacity is well retained at ~800 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to ~82% of that of the second cycle. This result is comparable or better than the best reversible capacity reported previously for MnO
 <sub>x</sub>-based LIB anodes, such as MnO/C core-shell nanorods
