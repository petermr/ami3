<p>The growth mechanism was proposed elsewhere
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In brief, the metal oleate, such as Mn(oleate)
 <sub>2</sub>, is formed first in the solution reaction, in which Mn is +2. The oleate ligands are thermally dissociated into CO
 <sub>2</sub>, thus remaining in MnO. In addition, the mesopores are formed during the formation/elimination of CO
 <sub>2</sub> from the reactants.
