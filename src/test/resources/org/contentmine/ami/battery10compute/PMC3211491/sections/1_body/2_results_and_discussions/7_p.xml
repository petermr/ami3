<p>Formation of composites by incorporation of MWCNTs can provide an enhanced electronic conductivity of electrodes and elastic buffers for releasing the strain of CuO during the Li conversion reaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> shows the XRD pattern of the CuO/MWCNT composites. Compared to the XRD pattern of pure CuO-interlaced nanodiscs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), that of the CuO/MWCNT composites showed an additional peak at 25Â° by the MWCNT phase. From a comparison of the weight loss between pure CuO and CuO/MWCNT composites using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), the incorporated amount of MWCNT in the composites corresponded to approximately 13%, as shown in Figure
