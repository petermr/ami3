<p>Herein, we demonstrate a low-temperature and large-scale conversion of initially prepared 1-D Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>nanowires into 2-D CuO nanodiscs and further vertically interlaced nanodisc structures. The detailed morphological evolution during the growth of the nanostructured CuO was examined by controlling the reaction conditions, such as synthesis time and temperature. The electrochemical reaction of Li with the obtained CuO nanodiscs was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling. Furthermore, the enhanced reversible capacities and capacity retention in the CuO nanodisc composite electrodes, by the incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), are reported by offering better efficient electron transport paths.
