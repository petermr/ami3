<p>Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref> shows the low magnification FESEM image of CuO powders. It can be clearly observed that uniform 2-D disc-like morphologies with an average diameter of 500-700 nm and a thickness of 30-50 nm were obtained on a large scale. More interestingly, more than one standing disc was inserted into the central part of the lying discs, indicating CuO-interlaced nanodisc structures. This characteristic nanostructure was also confirmed by local contrast differences in a representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of an individual disc (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The inset in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> depicts a typical CuO-interlaced nanodisc based on the FESEM and TEM observations. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> shows the magnified HRTEM image of the surface region in the nanodisc. The measured lattice spacings obtained from the HRTEM image were 2.76 and 2.30 Ã…, in accordance with the (110) and (200) planes of the monoclinic CuO structure, respectively.
