<p>The crystal structures of the obtained CuO products were analyzed through the XRD patterns in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>. All the reflection peaks could be completely indexed as well-crystalline, monoclinic CuO, which was in good agreement with literature values (JCPDS file no. 48-1548). As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, no characteristic peaks from unreacted starting materials or initially synthesized Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>precursors were detected on the XRD patterns of the products, indicating that all samples obtained were single-phase CuO.
