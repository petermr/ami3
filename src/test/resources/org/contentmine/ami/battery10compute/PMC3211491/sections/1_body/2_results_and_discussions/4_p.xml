<p>After achieving a temperature of 60Â°C, most morphology changed suddenly to a disc shape by the acceleration of the oriented attachment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>) because this 2-D compact nanostructure would be energetically favorable by reducing the interfacial energy of the 1-D nanowires [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>almost completely transformed into CuO. However, a small amount of the Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>phase remained, supported by the presence of nanowires reminiscent of the Cu(OH)
 <sub>2 </sub>precurso.r With a reaction time extended to 3 h, complete conversion to CuO was observed using XRD (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).
