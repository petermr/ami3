<p>For preparation of the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/CuO composites, a calculated amount (60 mg) of synthetic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT Co., Ltd., Incheon, South Korea) was first dispersed and sonicated for 3 h in 100 mL deionized water in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%, 0.2 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) [
