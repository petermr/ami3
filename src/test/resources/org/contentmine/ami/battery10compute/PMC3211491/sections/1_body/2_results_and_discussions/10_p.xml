<p>Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> represents the charge-discharge behavior of CuO/MWCNT composite electrodes at a rate of C/5. The first discharge and charge capacities were 1,025 and 657 mA h g
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and a high reversible capacity of approximately 440 mA h g
 <sup>-1 </sup>obtained after 20 cycles. These CuO/MWCNT composite nanostructures exhibited a higher reversible lithium storage capacity and better capacity retention than the pure CuO nanodiscs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The specific capacity of the CuO/MWCNT composites was estimated to be 47% greater than that of pure CuO nanodiscs. This additional lithium storage capacity in the CuO/MWCNT composites may result from the efficient electron transport by the incorporation of MWCNT in high surface area CuO nanostructures. Therefore, other surface modifications using carbon or conductive metals could possibly further improve electrochemical performance of these CuO nanostructures.
