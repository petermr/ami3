<p>The TiO
 <sub>2</sub> electrode was prepared by mixing the prepared active component with acetylene black and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The resultant slurry was then uniformly casted on pure Cu foil current collector and dried overnight under vacuum. The counter electrode was lithium foil for a half cell. The C-rate used is based on the anatase theoretical capacity of 168 mAh/g

 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:2). The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged at different current densities in a range of 1–3.0 V.
