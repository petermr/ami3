<p>To evaluate the cyclability at high rate, we cycled the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable at high rate of 5C and 50C over 2000 cycles. It can be seen clearly in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref> that the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a charge capacity of 187 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 2000 cycles at 5C, keeping a capacity retention of 90%. Even at extremely high rate of 50C, the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable still delivers high charge capacity of 122 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 2000 cycles with the capacity retention of 87%. This is far superior to the conventional TiO
 <sub>2</sub> anodes, typically with capacity fading of over 20% after 1000 cycles. Such superior electrochemical performances are very promising to meet the requirements for many long-term high-power applications.
