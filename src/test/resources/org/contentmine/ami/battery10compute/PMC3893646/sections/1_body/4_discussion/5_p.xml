<p>In summary, a new nanostructure, CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables were produced by a simple and green hydrothermal process. Using glucose as a structure-directing agent and carbon source, there is no need for any treatments for covalent/non-covalent functionalization of CNTs. Glucose was found to play multiple roles in the formation of the nanocable, including improving the interfacial interaction between TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and CNT to facilitate the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nucleation on the surface of CNTs, controlling the growth of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, and producing three-dimensional carbon conductive network with the CNT core around the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The synergistic effect of the reduced particle size, high electronic conductivity provided by inner CNT/outer carbon layer, mesoporous structure, and high surface area leads to superior electrochemical performance. It demonstrates excellent high-rate long-term cycling stability with a high charge capacity of 187 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 2000 cycles at 5C and 122 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 2000 cycles at 50 C.
