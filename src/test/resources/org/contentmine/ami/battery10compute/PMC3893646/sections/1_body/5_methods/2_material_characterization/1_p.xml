<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out by using a Panalytical diffractometer. The morphologies were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL 7500) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, 200 kV FEI monochromated F20 UT Tecnai). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Perkin Elemer TGA7) was carried out at a heating rate of 20°C/min from room temperature to 700°C with airflow. Pore size distributions were calculated from the adsorption branch of the N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherm using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyzer (BET, Micromeritics ASAP2020), and a Hall Effect measurement system (HMS-5000). Raman spectra were collected in the backscattering configuration using a micro-Raman spectrometer (Labram, ISA Groupe Horiba).
