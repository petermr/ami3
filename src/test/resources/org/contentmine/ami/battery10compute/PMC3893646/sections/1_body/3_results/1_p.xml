<p>The morphology of the prepared CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C hybrid material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Z-contrast annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM). Compared with pristine CNTs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables preserve the one-dimensional nanostructure of the CNT with the diameters ranging from 20 to 30 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b–c</xref>). The surfaces of CNTs become coarse, indicating the coating of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and carbon. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> show that a thin carbon layer was continuously wrapped on the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The presence of the carbon layer resulted from the carbonization of glucose derivatives can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of the hybrid material. Meanwhile, the carbon layer can act as a separator to restrain the growth of primary TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles during the hydrothermal and annealing process and therefore keep the particle size at nanoscale. The crystallite sizes are below 8 nm as determined from TEM images. The lattice fringes observed in HR-TEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and its corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref> reveal the crystal structure to be anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. From ADF-STEM Z-contrast images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>), it is shown that the high-contrast TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles covering on the surface of CNT are relatively homogeneous. The near-edge fine structure of the Ti L2,3 edge in the electron energy loss spectrum designates the nanoparticles to be stoichiometric TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. To better illustrate the nanostructure of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C, more SEM and TEM images at different magnifications are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supplementary Fig. S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S2</xref>. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption-desorption measurements were performed to determine the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the porosity of the prepared material. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref> shows the adsorption/desorption isotherms of CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables, which exhibits a hysteresis of typical type IV isotherm, demonstrating a porous structure with a BET specific surface area of 75.8 m
