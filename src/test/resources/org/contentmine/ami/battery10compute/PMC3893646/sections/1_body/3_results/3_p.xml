<p>To unravel the impact of the glucose and CNTs on the structure formation, the samples were prepared in the absence of glucose and CNTs. In sharp contrast, in the absence of the glucose, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> precipitated in form of large clusters (named as CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite) without the formation of the nanocable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–b</xref>). Without the addition of CNT and glucose, only agglomerated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were obtained (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> reported that the surface properties of CNTs were crucial to control the morphology and structure of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> coating. Therefore, we speculate that the glucose alters the surface property of CNT and plays a role as a structure-directing agent in the formation of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables. It has been reported that the dehydration and aromatization usually occur during the hydrothermal reaction of glucose

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The FT-IR spectrum was used to track the process (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supplementary Fig. S5</xref> online). The increase in the intensity of the band at 1620 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C = C) for CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables in comparison with pristine CNT and CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite supports the aromatization of glucose during the hydrothermal process. Meanwhile, the appearance of the bands in the range of 1000–1300 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which can be assigned to the C-OH stretching and O-H bending vibrations, implies the existence of large quantities of hydroxyl groups. In accordance with our speculation, these aromatic compounds with a lot of hydroxyl groups resulted from the glucose aromatization act as the bridge to connect TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and CNT by π–π interactions. Apart from being a structure-directing agent, the glucose also affects the crystallization and grain growth of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> crystal. The effect of glucose on crystal was clarified by XRD, which shows that the diffraction peaks become broader with the increasing of the glucose content (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supplementary Fig. S6</xref> online). Even annealed at 700°C for 3 h, most of the diffraction peaks of the product synthesized by adding the higher content of glucose are still too broad to be detected. According to the Scherrer formula, it demonstrates that the average crystallite size in CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable decreases with increasing the amount of glucose in the hydrothermal reaction. Presumably, the glucose-derived compounds absorbing on titania nanoparticle limited further structural growth and the final size of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, which is similar to the surfactant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Therefore, it can be concluded that the glucose plays multi-roles in the formation of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable, including structure-directing agent, carbon source, and surfactant.
