<p>In this work, we present a simple and green one-pot route to form a new nanostructured CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable by using glucose as structure-directing agent and carbon source without any prerequisite for covalent/non-covalent functionalization of CNTs. Although glucose is often used as a carbon source in hydrothermal reactions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, it is the first time to be used as a structure-directing agent to form CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable. It was reported that some aromatic compounds can be produced during the hydrothermal process of glucose

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Therefore, it can be expected that these aromatic compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups originated from glucose can act as a bridge to connect TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and CNTs by π–π interactions just like the BA surfactant

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Consistent with the hypothesis, using the glucose as structure-directing agent and carbon source, a new hybrid nanostructure CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable with high electronic and ionic conducting network was prepared in one pot, which showed high specific capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent long-term cycling stability as anode material for LIBs in half cell. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows the one-pot hydrothermal routine to prepare the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable. Using glucose to facilitate the formation of CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable in one pot presents multiple highlights: 1) the utilization of glucose not only solves the interfacial incompatibility between CNTs and titanate sol, but also provides molecular template to control the nucleation and growth of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>; 2) the carbon-rich polysaccharide derived from the glucose can integrate the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with high electronic conductive CNT core to form a three-dimensional electronic conducting network; 3) the whole process is simple and intrinsically green because it only uses CNTs, titanium isopropoxide, and glucose as the precursors (see Experimental Section for more details); 4) glucose is an abundant and environmentally benign product, which can reduce the cost of the hybrid material.
