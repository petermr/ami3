<p>To better know the electrochemical performance of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable, CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite synthesized in the absence of glucose and commercial TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (particle size &lt;25 nm) were studied as counterparts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref> shows the charge-discharge profiles of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable, CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite, and commercial TiO
 <sub>2</sub> at a rate of 0.5 C. The voltage profiles of the three TiO
 <sub>2</sub> materials in the first discharge process show three distinct regions. Region A ranging from OCV to ~1.75 V shows a rapid voltage drop, which is known as a homogeneous Li
 <sup>+</sup> insertion into the bulk by a solid-solution insertion mechanism
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. A well-known two-phase plateau in region B is observed at ~1.75 V, where Li-rich phases and Li-poor phases coexist
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. After the two-phase plateau, the region C at below 1.75 V exhibits a sloped curve. This process can be attributed to the reversible surface/interfacial lithium storage on the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and carbon, which is consistent with the above rectangular curves in the CV shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5a</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> summarizes the capacities corresponding to the three different electrochemical processes in the first cycle. It can be observed that the region A and B provide a large proportion of lithium storage contribution for the commercial TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle, which has the largest region B and relatively smaller region C. The CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite has a relatively long region B as well as a long region C. In sharp contrast, the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable has a very small region B and the largest region C as the main lithium storage region. It is consistent with the reported results that the proportion of region A+B decreases, while region C increases with a decreasing of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particle size

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. It should be mentioned that these sloped charge-discharge voltage profiles were observed at all different rates (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supplementary Fig. S7</xref> online). This sloped voltage profile can be mainly attributed to the decreased crystallite size of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and the porous nanostructure of the hybrid material
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable, the size of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles is below 8 nm and these particles are isolated by carbon layer to constrain the direct connection and growth of primary particles which provides much more surface/interfacial space for lithium storage.
