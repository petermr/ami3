 <p>A well-designed nanostructure CNT@TiO
  <sub>2</sub>-C with fine anatase TiO
  <sub>2</sub> particle (&lt; 8 nm), good electronic conducting network (inner CNT core and outer carbon layer), and mesoporous structure was prepared by a simple and green one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The utilization of glucose in the hydrothermal process not only solves the interfacial incompatibility between CNTs and titanate sol and controls the nucleation and growth of TiO
  <sub>2</sub> particles, but also introduces a uniform, glucose-derived, carbon-layer on the TiO
  <sub>2</sub> particles. The nanosized TiO
  <sub>2</sub> particle, high conducting network, and interconnected nanopores of the CNT@TiO
  <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable greatly improve its electrochemical performances, especially rate capability. The CNT@TiO
  <sub>2</sub>-C nanocables show remarkable rate capability with reversible charge capacity of 297, 240, 210,178 and 127 mAh g
  <sup>−1</sup> at 1C, 5C, 10C, 20C and 50C, respectively, as well as excellent high rate cycling stability with capacity retention of 87% after 2000 cycles at 50C.
