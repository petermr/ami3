 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> displays the rate capability of the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable at different rates from 0.5C to 50C, and the results for the CNT/TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and the commercial TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle are also included for comparison. The rate comparison between the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable and the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle prepared by similar processes is also provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supplementary Fig. S8</xref>. As expected, the CNT@TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-C nanocable exhibits superior rate capability compared to the counterparts at the same testing condition, with the charge capacity of 210 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10C, 178 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20C, and 127 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 50C. More importantly, a stable capacity of 285 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> can be delivered when the rate was reduced back to 0.5C, suggesting good structural stability of the nanocable and high reversibility even after high rate charge-discharge. It should be noted that the high-rate capability is similar to the best nanostructured or hybrid TiO
 <sub>2</sub> electrodes reported so far under similar testing conditions as shown in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Such excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the following aspects. The nanosized TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles reduce Li
 <sup>+</sup> diffusion distance and increase the surface/interfacial space for lithium storage, which facilitates the ionic and electronic transport and provides additional supercapacitance capacity contribution. Furthermore, the three-dimensional conductive network around each TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle formed by the inner CNT core and the outer carbon layer significantly improves the entire electronic conductivity of the nanocable to facilitate the electrochemical processes, even charge-discharge at high rate. Besides, the mesoporous structure of the nanocable ensures more particles to be wetted by the liquid electrolyte, thus improving the rate performance.
