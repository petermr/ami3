  <title>Stability study of Li

   <sub>3</sub> phase on a lithiated NiO nanosheet.

  <p>(a) Annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) image with an area identified for EELS acquisition. (A 200 keV electron beam (~12 pA) rapidly scanned the area repeatedly to spread the dose during EELS acquisition.) (b) C K-edge EELS spectra. (c) O K-edge EELS spectra. Each spectrum was integrated for 5 sec with a dose rate of 100 electrons/Å
   <sup>2</sup>/sec and an accumulated dose of 500 electrons/Å
   <sup>2</sup>. The critical dose limit for lithium carbonate is estimated to be approximately 750 electrons/Å
   <sup>2</sup> placing it in sensitivity next to biomolecules (&lt;200 electrons/Å
   <sup>2</sup> at 77 K)
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The arrow to the right of (c) indicates the increased acquisition time from the bottom to the top in (b) and (c), with an interval of 5 sec.
