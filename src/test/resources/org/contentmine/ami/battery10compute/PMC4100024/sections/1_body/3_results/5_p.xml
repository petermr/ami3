<p>Decreasing the dose rate is critical in reducing radiation damage because isolated bond breaking is healable in conductive solid samples

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Rastering the beam over an area is an efficient way to reduce the dose rate. If the beam is idle, the dose rate is the beam current normalized by the beam area. If the beam is scanned sufficiently fast, the dose is spread out over the scanning area; in this case, the dose rate is the beam current normalized by the entire scanning area. To test how scan rate affect the dose rate, we performed a parallel experiment to compare with the condition used in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, we preserved the beam current, the field of view, and the dwell time but reduced the pixel number by a factor of four (i.e. scanning was four times faster). When the beam damage was compared under these two conditions after similar number of frames (i.e., similar repeat of electron beam scanning), it shows that the structural damage was significant less than that in
