<p>The identification of the chemical environment of SRLs (e.g., solid-electrolyte interphases) is essential to understanding their functionalities in the battery operation

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows EELS measurements on a lithiated NiO nanosheet. In a previous study, we showed that, in NiO nanosheets, the SRLs are primarily composed of Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> embedded in a complex organic matrix
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Indeed, the fingerprints for the 1s to π* transition of the CO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>2−</sup> group are simultaneously observed in the C K-edge and O K-edge spectra, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c</xref>, respectively. The well-defined characteristic peaks were gradually degraded after repeated EELS acquisition over the area indicated by the dashed boxed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>, and the fine structures of the CO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>2−</sup> group disappeared after four acquisitions. The compounds in the SRLs are usually prone to thermal decomposition
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Here we showed that the combined knock-on, ionization, and thermal effects of the electron beam readily broke down the surface structure leading to the degradation of the SRL. The damage can be mitigated by acquiring EELS data from a larger area while keeping the dose below the critical limit. In addition, the critical dose limit (measured in electrons/Å
 <sup>2</sup>) is generally dependent on the dose rate (measured in electrons/Å
 <sup>2</sup>/sec). By decreasing the dose rate (i.e. reducing the incident beam current while keeping the scanning area constant), the damage rate can potentially be reduced
