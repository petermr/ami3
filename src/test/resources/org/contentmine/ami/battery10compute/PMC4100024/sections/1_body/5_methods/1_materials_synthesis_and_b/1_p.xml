 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In short, NiO was synthesized using a solvothermal method aided with an alcohol pseudo-supercritical drying technique. NMC was synthesized using a co-precipitation method followed by high-temperature annealing with LiOH. 2032 Coin cells were fabricated using composites of NiO or NMC as working electrodes and lithium metal foils as counter electrodes. The NiO working electrodes were composed of 80 wt.% active material, 10 wt.% polyvinylidene fluoride (Kureha Chemical Ind. Co. Ltd) and 10 wt.% acetylene carbon black (Denka, 50% compressed) and loadings were typically 1–2 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> of active material. To make the electrodes, these solids were mixed into N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and the resulting slurry cast onto copper current collectors and dried. NMC working electrodes were prepared similarly and contained 84 wt.% active material, 8 wt.% polyvinylidene fluoride, 4 wt.% acetylene carbon black and 4 wt.% SFG-6 synthetic graphite on carbon-coated aluminum current collectors, with typical active material loadings of 6–7 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The coin cells were assembled in a helium-filled glove box using Celgard 2400 separators and 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> electrolyte in 1:2 w/w ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (Ferro Corporation). Battery testing was performed on a computer controlled VMP3 potentiostat/galvanostat (BioLogic). NiO and NMC electrodes were cycled at C/2 and C/20 rates, respectively. 1C was defined as fully discharging or charging an electrode in 1 h, corresponding to specific current densities of 718 mA/g and 280 mA/g for NiO and NMC materials, respectively.
