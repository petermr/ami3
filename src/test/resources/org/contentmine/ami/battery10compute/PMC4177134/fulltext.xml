[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, several issues were brought about due to inherent electrochemical characteristics of graphite; electrodeposition of lithium at the surface of graphite during quick charging, and a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation by the secondary reactions between graphite and electrolyte. These problems deteriorated the performance of the graphite electrode, resulting in shorter lifetime and reduced capacity. Thus, an alternative electrode material has been actively explored to replace it. In particular, electric vehicles requiring fast charging need electrode materials not only experiencing little lattice distortions during charge&#x02013;discharge cycles, but having a long lifetime, high stability, and high discharging capacity, etc. And most of all, they need to be fabricated at a reasonably low cost.</p><p>Among the promising materials to replace the graphite electrode, nano-structured TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs have attracted much attention due to their high capacity and micro-channeled structure appropriate for intercalation and deintercalation of the Li ions during charge&#x02013;discharge cycles
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The space existing between layers in the crystalline structure as well as within the TiO<sub>2</sub> particles could facilitate the intercalation and deintercalation of Li<sup>+</sup> ions during the process. Especially, TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) having relatively open structures compared to Rutile, Anatase, and Brookite has an obvious advantage for the intercalation and deintercalation of Li<sup>+</sup> ions without severe lattice distortions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The favorable structural characteristics of the TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) mentioned above are believed to improve the lifetime and performance of the battery
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, the fabrication of TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) particles is relatively simple and easy to scale up for high volume production.</p><p>In this study, we obtained belt or wire shaped TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) particles to use as a negative electrode by a hydrothermal and heat treatment process. Ball milling process was utilized to crush the synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) particles into smaller sizes to facilitate TiO<sub>2</sub>(B)/C composites fabrication. The effects of ball mill treatment on the electrochemical performance of the TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) particles were evaluated in terms of microstructure and phase changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental details</title><p>For preparing TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powder, 0.1&#x000a0;M P25 powder was at first put into 10&#x000a0;M aqueous NaOH solution, and then the solution was hydrothermally heated at 180&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;hrs. The obtained particles were calcined at 450&#x000b0;C for 6&#x000a0;hrs in air, resulted in having TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) phase with nanobelt of thin and long length. After that ball-milling was conducted on TiO<sub>2</sub>(B), materials and electrochemical characterizations were carried out using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy, S-4700, Hitachi), XRD (X-Ray Diffraction, D/MAX 2500, Rigaku) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishow, invia Raman Microscope). As the milling time increased, particle size of TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders decreased from 24&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m to 0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m through a 300&#x000a0;rpm, 3&#x000a0;hrs ball-milling. Here, the size was measured using PSA (Particle Size Analyzer with laser scattering, Photal ELS-800, Otsuka electronics).</p><p>Electrochemical properties were measured with R2032 coin-type cells. A metal lithium foil was used as the anode. Composite electrodes were prepared by mixing 80&#x000a0;wt% TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders, 10&#x000a0;wt% conductive Super-P, 10&#x000a0;wt% SBR-CMC binder, and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form uniform slurry. A solution of 1&#x000a0;M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 w/w) was used as the electrolyte. The cells were charged and discharged between 1.0 and 3.0&#x000a0;V by applying a constant current of 50 mAg<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders were synthesized by the heat treatment of the rod or belt-shaped H-titanate powders at 450&#x000b0;C for 6&#x000a0;hrs, which had been prepared by a hydrothermal process. The combined process of the hydrothermal and heat treatment has been used for the synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders were ball milled using a planetary type ball mill at a fixed rotation speed of 300&#x000a0;rpm for up to 3&#x000a0;hrs to make them smaller sizes. The changes of morphology and size of the powders with the milling time were observed under SEM as shown in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The as-synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders were observed from Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(a) to be long rod or belt shaped. The powders were broken into smaller sizes after 1&#x000a0;hr ball milling (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(b)). However, they became severely agglomerated after ball milling for 3&#x000a0;hrs as can be seen in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(c). The size distribution of the TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders with the milling time was graphed in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. As-synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) powders with an average of 24 &#x003bc;m became broken into smaller sizes of 0.7 and 0.2 &#x003bc;m after ball milling for 1 and 3&#x000a0;hrs, respectively.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>SEM images for planetary-milled TiO</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>(B) powders with 300&#x000a0;rpm and various milling times.

As-synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) sample had the charging capacity of about 217 mAh/g, discharging capacity of 190 mAh/g, and the resultant irreversibility of about 12.4%. Meanwhile, the sample ball milled for 3&#x000a0;hrs was measured with the charging capacity of about 180 mAh/g, discharging capacity of 164 mAh/g.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The initial charge&#x02013;discharge curves of planetary-milled TiO</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>(B) with milling times by laser scattering (PSA) shown in Figure </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref><bold>.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Similar to our results, TiO<sub>2</sub> anode materials with anatase or rutile phase were reported to have a relatively low charging capacity of about 150 &#x02013; 200 mAh/g
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is also well known that charge&#x02013;discharge capacity is much affected by the particle size of the electrode materials; smaller particles show better performance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) sample ball milled for 1&#x000a0;hr was measured to have a high charging capacity of 250 mAh/g and discharging capacity of 232 mAh/g, and irreversibility of 7%. Based on the results with 1&#x000a0;hr and 3&#x000a0;hrs ball milled samples, the performance was found to be affected positively by the smaller scale of particles, but negatively by the presence of anatase phase; the presence of anatase phase with a strong intensity in the 3&#x000a0;hrs ball milled sample even with smallest particles deteriorated the performance.</p><p>Cyclic stability of charge&#x02013;discharge capacity and capacity variation as a function of C-rate was compared among the samples in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. As can be seen in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>(a), TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) sample ball milled 1&#x000a0;hr showed a high degree of cyclic stability. About 98% of the initial discharge capacity was maintained even after 50&#x000a0;cycles; initial capacity of 232 mAh/g was reduced only to 227 mAh/g. On the other hand, as-synthesized sample and 3&#x000a0;hrs ball milled sample showed a gradual decrease of the capacity with the cycle suggesting smaller particle size without anatase phase in TiO<sub>2</sub>(B) was an optimum condition for the high electrochemical performance. Discharging capacity was gradually decreased with the C-rate regardless of the sample types as compared in graph Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>(b).
