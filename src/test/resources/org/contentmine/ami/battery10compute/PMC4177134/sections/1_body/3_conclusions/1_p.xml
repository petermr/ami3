<p>TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) particles were synthesized for lithium ion battery application by a hydrothermal and subsequent heat treatment processes. They were rod or thin belt shaped of about 24 microns in average size. For the efficient fabrication of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B)/C composite anode materials, the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) particles were crushed into smaller sizes by ball milling process. Prolonged ball milling for up to 3 hrs produced particles with the average size of less than 1.0 μm. However, 3 hrs ball milled sample showed the anatase phase with a strong intensity by Raman spectra observation. Similar to other research results, the sample with the strong anatase peaks was measured to have a relatively low reversible capacity of 165 mAh/g compared to 190 mAh/g of as-synthesized sample. On the other hand, the sample ball milled for 1 hr, consisting of less than 1.0 μm particles with weak anatase peaks, showed much improved reversible capacity of 232 mAh/g.
