 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the initial charge–discharge performance for the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) samples measured in the range of 1.0 – 3.0 V with a lithium foil as a counter electrode. As-synthesized TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) sample had the charging capacity of about 217 mAh/g, discharging capacity of 190 mAh/g, and the resultant irreversibility of about 12.4%. Meanwhile, the sample ball milled for 3 hrs was measured with the charging capacity of about 180 mAh/g, discharging capacity of 164 mAh/g.
