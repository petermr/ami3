<p>For preparing TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powder, 0.1 M P25 powder was at first put into 10 M aqueous NaOH solution, and then the solution was hydrothermally heated at 180°C for 24 hrs. The obtained particles were calcined at 450°C for 6 hrs in air, resulted in having TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) phase with nanobelt of thin and long length. After that ball-milling was conducted on TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B), materials and electrochemical characterizations were carried out using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy, S-4700, Hitachi), XRD (X-Ray Diffraction, D/MAX 2500, Rigaku) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishow, invia Raman Microscope). As the milling time increased, particle size of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) powders decreased from 24 μm to 0.2 μm through a 300 rpm, 3 hrs ball-milling. Here, the size was measured using PSA (Particle Size Analyzer with laser scattering, Photal ELS-800, Otsuka electronics).
