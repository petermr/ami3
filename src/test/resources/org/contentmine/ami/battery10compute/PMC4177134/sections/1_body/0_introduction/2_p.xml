<p>Among the promising materials to replace the graphite electrode, nano-structured TiO
 <sub>2</sub> polymorphs have attracted much attention due to their high capacity and micro-channeled structure appropriate for intercalation and deintercalation of the Li ions during chargeâ€“discharge cycles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The space existing between layers in the crystalline structure as well as within the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles could facilitate the intercalation and deintercalation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions during the process. Especially, TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) having relatively open structures compared to Rutile, Anatase, and Brookite has an obvious advantage for the intercalation and deintercalation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions without severe lattice distortions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The favorable structural characteristics of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) mentioned above are believed to improve the lifetime and performance of the battery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, the fabrication of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) particles is relatively simple and easy to scale up for high volume production.
