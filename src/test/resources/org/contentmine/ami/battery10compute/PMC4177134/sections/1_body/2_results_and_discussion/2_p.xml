<p>Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows the XRD patterns and Raman spectra for the samples of as-synthesized and ball milled for up to 3 hrs. Typical peaks for TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) phase were observed from all the samples as in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>(a). It was also noticed that the intensity of the main peak at 24.979 deg. was gradually decreased but the FWHM was increased with the milling time, indicating the particles were becoming smaller sizes. These results were found to be consistent with the SEM observations in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for the size changes of the particles with the milling time.
