<p>The reduced charge–discharge capacity of the 3 hrs ball milled sample seemed to be caused by the presence of the strong anatase peaks identified with Raman spectra in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Similar to our results, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> anode materials with anatase or rutile phase were reported to have a relatively low charging capacity of about 150 – 200 mAh/g [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is also well known that charge–discharge capacity is much affected by the particle size of the electrode materials; smaller particles show better performance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(B) sample ball milled for 1 hr was measured to have a high charging capacity of 250 mAh/g and discharging capacity of 232 mAh/g, and irreversibility of 7%. Based on the results with 1 hr and 3 hrs ball milled samples, the performance was found to be affected positively by the smaller scale of particles, but negatively by the presence of anatase phase; the presence of anatase phase with a strong intensity in the 3 hrs ball milled sample even with smallest particles deteriorated the performance.
