<p>Pristine purpurin was chemically lithiated by following the basic lithiation chemistry procedures reported in the literature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Lithium acetate dihydrate (1.02 g, 10 mmol) in 10 mL of MeOH was added drop-wise to a solution of purpurin (2.56 g, 10 mmol) dissolved in 100 mL of methanol. During the addition of LiOAc solution, reddish yellow colored purpurin solution turned to pink, and the resultant solution was stirred vigorously for 10 minutes. The 1:1 ratio of chemically lithiated purpurin (CLP) was obtained by removing the solvent from the reaction mixture and by drying the solid product under vacuum. Similar procedure was followed for the preparation of 1:2 ratio of CLP, by increasing the molar equivalent of LiOAc twice.
