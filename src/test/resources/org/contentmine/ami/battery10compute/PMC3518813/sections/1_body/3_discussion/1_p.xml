<p>We have explored chemical and electrochemical reversible lithium ion properties and understood the reaction mechanism in purpurin molecule. Reversible lithiation/de-lithiation process in purpurin electrode is observed from electrochemical studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Observed anodic peak at 2 V and cathodic peaks ~2.6 and 3.2 V from cyclic voltammetry studies are clear evidence of reversible lithiation/de-lithiation process in purpurin molecule. Similar Galvanostatic charge/discharge behavior observed in purpurin and CLP is a clear indication that CLP can alone stand as cathode material. The reversible capacity of 90 mAh/g obtained after 50 charge/discharge cycles in purpurin is comparable to conventional inorganic insertion cathodes such as LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> or LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> and also with recently studied other organic compounds such as Li
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> and Li
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>O

We believe that the specific capacities and rate capabilities of these low electron conducting organic molecules can be further improved by using specially engineered current collectors reported in reference number 29 and 30. Further, proposed mechanism in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> and existence of different molecular forms of purpurin are based on detailed NMR, FTIR, UV and XPS studies. Thorough NMR studies on both CLP and ELP molecules at various stages of lithiation process supports the binding of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions with carbonyls and simultaneously with the nearby hydroxyl groups of purpurin as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>. It should be noted that purpurin and its lithiated analogues have different levels of CH (sp
 <sup>3</sup>) character of the bridgehead carbons. The formation of most favored six membered co-ordination site optimize the lithiation process and further increases the capacity of the purpurin-based electrodes.
