<p>The Lithiation process in purpurin was further substantiated by UV/VIS and FTIR analysis. Optical absorption spectra of purpurin (1×10
 <sup>−4</sup> M) upon titration with Li
 <sup>+</sup> (1×10
 <sup>−4</sup> M) indicated some absorbance changes in UV/vis region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref>). Lithiation of purpurin leads to the decrease in the absorption in the region of 481 nm with red shift of absorption band from 481 to 487 nm. In addition, appearance of a new band at 514 nm was observed and it was enhanced with the subsequent addition of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions. Once it reached the ratio of 1:2 purpurin to lithium, no amendment in absorption was perceived (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref>). FTIR analysis of ELP-1 showed new carbonyl stretching absorption bands at around 1780 and 1800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, whereas they were absent in the case of pristine purpurin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref>). Further, solid product obtained after several cycles of charge/discharge process was characterized using a PHI Quantera photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with an Al anode source operated at 15 kV and an applied power of 350 W. Lithiated purpurin samples after last discharge was load locked into the XPS machine without exposing it to ambient air. XPS profiles were analyzed by focusing on the regions where the signals of C1s, O1s and Li1s are expected and compared with that of pristine purpurin (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S4</xref>, which specifies the presence of both carbon and oxygen similar to that of purpurin (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supporting information Figure S4</xref>) and an additional peak at a binding energy of ~55 eV the presence of lithium in the sample. Further, the core level spectra of Li1s is also obtained by focusing the region corresponding to Li1s signal and presented as inset in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5</xref>. The corresponding C1s and O1s core levels in lithiated purpurin are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">supporting information Figure S6</xref>. The Li1s core level spectra has been corrected for any background signals using the Shirley algorithm prior to curve resolution and then resolved into two components centered at ~54.8 and 56 eV as shown in inset of 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5</xref>. The lower binding energy component centered at 54.8 eV confirms the formation of –OLi in the coordination compound and the higher binding energy component centered at 56 eV corresponds to lithium oxide, which may be due to an impurity left in the purpurin sample.
