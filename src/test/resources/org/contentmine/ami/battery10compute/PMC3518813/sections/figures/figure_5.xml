  <p>(a) UV/vis absorption titration curves of purpurin (1×10
   <sup>−4</sup> M) with addition of LiOAc (1×10
   <sup>−4</sup> M) in methanol at 298 K. The ratio of purpurin with LiOAc was changed throughout the titration in different ratios, starting from 20:0 to 4:16 (top to bottom), and change in absorption curves were pointed out by arrows and (b) FT-IR (ATR) spectrum of purpurin (black) and ELP-1 (red). The inset shows an expanded view, where the existence of new absorption bands for carbonyl groups is clearly visible and point out by arrow.
