<p>To conclude, we have demonstrated reversible lithiation/de-lithiation properties in purpurin molecules that is derived from a widely available plant Madder. The lithium batteries assembled using purpurin and chemically lithiated purpurin as working electrodes showed good charge/discharge characteristics with a reversible capacity of ~90â€…mAh/g. The chemistry behind the lithiation of purpurin molecule was studied with NMR, UV and FTIR. We demonstrate that the binding of two lithium ions with purpurin molecule by the shared binding of carbonyl and nearby hydroxyl group, lead to the formation of most favored six membered structure. Our results pay a way towards the development of green and sustainable lithium battery electrodes from plant/crop-based materials
