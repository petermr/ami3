 <caption>
  <p>(a) Schematic illustration of sequence of lithiation/de-lithiation mechanism in the purpurin molecule: (1) Molecular structure of pristine purpurin; (2) Intermediate of lithiated purpurin, and (3) Binding of lithium ion with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of purpurin at C-1 (–OH
   <sub>a</sub>) and C-4 (–OH
   <sub>c</sub>) respectively. (b) Photograph of (1) pristine purpurin and (2) Chemically lithiated purpurin (1:2 ratio).
