 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Energy storage is a key component in this energy conversion-storage-delivery chain. Among various electrochemical energy storage options, lithium ion batteries have drawn utmost attention due to their reversible electrochemistry and superior gravimetric and volumetric energy storage capacities

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Research on lithium-ion battery (ever since its discovery in 1991 by Sony) was directed mainly towards the synthesis of high capacity materials and lead to the development of several non-renewable cathodes like LiCoO

 <sub>2</sub>) as cathode, face severe safety issues and 30% of globally produced cobalt is channeled into battery technology
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Also, extracting raw materials from ores and transforming them into electrochemically active material requires increasing amounts of energy as they become scarcer. Further, recycling of current lithium ion batteries has become a very challenging process as it involves elevated temperatures and liberates high amounts of CO
