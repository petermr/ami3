<p>The structural stabilities of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders post-treated at 450°C during cycling were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4a and 4b</xref>. Impedance measurements were carried out at room temperature on cells before cycling and after 50 cycles in the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V at a current density of 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The Nyquist plots of the electrodes were composed of a semicircle in the medium frequency region and an inclined line at low frequencies. The medium-frequency semicircle was assigned to the charge-transfer resistance, and the line inclined at ~45° to the real axis corresponded to the lithium diffusion process within the electrodes

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> filled powders, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>. The high contact area between the active material and electrolyte resulted in the high charge transfer resistance of the ZnFe

 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders with high surface area and enough void volume inside the powder for electrolyte penetration
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The charge transfer resistances of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with both yolk–shell and filled structures decreased after cycling because of the formation of an amorphous structure after cycling. The ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders had lower charge transfer resistance than the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled structure after 50 cycles, as shown in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The low charge transfer resistance and high lithium ion diffusion rate of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders are due to their structural stability during cycling at a high current density. The slope of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders decreased after cycling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref>). The formation of a stable amorphous structure after cycling enhanced the Li
 <sup>+</sup> diffusion rate and facilitated rapid Li
 <sup>+</sup> charge/discharge of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figures S5 and S6</xref> show the morphology changes of the ZnFe

 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled and yolk-shell structures after 50 cycles. The spherical shape of the powder with filled structure was destroyed after cycling as shown in the TEM images (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5</xref>). However, the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders maintained their spherical morphology even after cycling as shown in the field emission SEM and TEM images (
