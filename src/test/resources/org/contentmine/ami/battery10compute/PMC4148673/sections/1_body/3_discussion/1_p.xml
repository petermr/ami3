<p>A large-scale production method of fabricating binary transition-metal oxide yolk–shell powders by applying a simple spray-drying process was proposed. The preparation of precursor powders with low hygroscopicity, a dense structure, and a spherical shape by applying dextrin as an appropriate carbon source material was key to the preparation of these powders. The optimum post-treatment temperature to obtain the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders with good electrochemical properties was 450°C. The ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders had higher initial discharge capacity and Coulombic efficiency and better cycling performance than the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> powders with filled structure prepared by the same process. The structural stability of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders during cycling, a structure consisting of double shells and one core, enhanced the electrochemical properties of the ZnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> yolk–shell powders. The spray-drying process with a dextrin additive could be widely applied for large-scale production of multicomponent oxide materials with yolk–shell structures.
