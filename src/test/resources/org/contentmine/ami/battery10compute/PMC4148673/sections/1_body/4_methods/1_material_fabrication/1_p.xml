<p>A commercial spray-drying process was used to prepare powders with filled structure. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S7</xref> shows a schematic diagram of the spray-drying process. The aqueous spray solution was prepared using zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O], iron nitrate nonahydrate [Fe(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>·9H
 <sub>2</sub>O], and dextrin [(C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>)
 <sub>n</sub>]. The total concentration of the Zn and Fe components dissolved in distilled water was 0.1 M. The total amount of dextrin was fixed at 50 g L
 <sup>−1</sup>. The spray solution containing a high concentration of the zinc and iron components was pumped into an atomizing device, where it was transformed into a spray of small droplets. A two-fluid nozzle was used as an atomizer, and the atomization pressure was 2.0 bar. These droplets were then brought into contact with a stream of hot air, which resulted in rapid evaporation of the moisture while the droplets were suspended in the drying air. The dry powder was separated from the humid air by centrifugal force in a cyclone system. The temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the spray dryer were 350°C and 120°C, respectively. The as-fabricated powders obtained by the spray-drying process, denoted herein as “precursor powders,” were subsequently post-treated in air at temperatures between 350 and 450°C for 3 h.
