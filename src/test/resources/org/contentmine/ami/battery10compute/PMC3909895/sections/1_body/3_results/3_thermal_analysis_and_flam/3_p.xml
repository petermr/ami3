 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> listed limiting oxygen index (LOI) and heat release of PP separator and FCCN separator. LOI, which corresponds to the percentage of oxygen in an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, is used to assess flame retardancy of polymeric materials
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The higher the value of LOI is, the better the flame retardancy is. As 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> indicated, the LOI value of FCCN separator was 40%, which was much higher than that of PP separator (18%). In addition, combustion behavior of PP separator and FCCN separator was displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4d</xref>. PP separator ignited and burned more quickly, while FCCN separator hardly ignited. It was deduced that inflame retarding property of FCCN separator was superior to that of PP separator. Automatic oxygen bomb calorimeter was used to assess heat release value quantitatively. It was worth noting that the heat release of FCCN separator (9662 J/g) was much lower than that of PP separator (45326 J/g). The superior inflame retarding property and lower heat release of FCCN separator could significantly improve the safety characteristics of LIB.
