<p>In conclusion, a cellulose-based composite separator with good electrolyte wettability, high ionic conductivity, excellent flame retardancy and superior thermal resistance was developed for improving the safety characteristics of LIB. It was demonstrated that the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphite cell using FCCN separator displayed better rate capability and enhanced capacity retention when compared to those of PP separator. In addition, FCCN separator based lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>)/lithium (Li) cell exhibited stable charge-discharge profiles and satisfactory cycling stability even at an elevated temperature of 120Â°C. Those advantages endow it a promising separator for LIB that powers consumer electronics and hybrid electric vehicles. All these results suggest that such FCCN separator is also very attractive in other electrochemical devices (such as sodium ion battery, lithium-sulfur battery and super capacitor)
