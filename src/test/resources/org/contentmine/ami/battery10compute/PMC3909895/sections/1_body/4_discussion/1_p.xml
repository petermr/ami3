<p>The practical application of FCCN separator for LIB was explored in terms of cell performance, which included rate capability and cycle performance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> displayed rate capability plots of the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphite cells from 2.75 to 4.20 V at different rates (0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1.0 C, 2.0 C, 4.0 C and 8.0 C). It can be observed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> that the cell at 0.2 C achieved the highest specific capacity, 129 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> for FCCN separator and 128 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> for PP separator. In addition, the discharge capacities of the cell using FCCN separator decreased with increasing discharge rates, but it still kept relatively high capacity as a whole. In the case of the cells with FCCN separator, the capacity kept 107 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 4 C and 83 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 8 C rate, respectively. However, the capacity of the cells employing PP separator decreased rapidly to 86 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 4 C and 47 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 8 C, respectively. It was reasonable to deduce that the FCCN separator exhibited much better rate capability when compared to that of PP separators. Superior rate performance was ascribed to the higher ionic conductivity and lower interfacial resistance of FCCN separator
