 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> outlined the preparation process of the FCCN separator. Cellulose pulp (20 g), sodium alginate (SA) (10 g), flame retardant (FR) (10 g) and silica (5 g) were placed into 1 L deionized water and pulped for 5 h to yield completely dispersed FCCN suspension. The obtained FCCN suspension was poured on a papermaking machine followed by vacuum filtration to generate a wet FCCN paper. Then the wet FCCN paper was transferred to a plate dryer to remove additional water and subsequently rolled under a pressure of 10 MPa at 95°C, leading to the generation of a FCCN separator. Cellulose nonwoven separator without flame retardant, sodium alginate and silica (abbreviated as “CN separator”) was prepared by papermaking method for a fair comparison.
