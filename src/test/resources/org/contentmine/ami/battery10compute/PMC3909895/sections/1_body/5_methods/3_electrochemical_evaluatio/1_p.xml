<p>The separators for the electrochemical stability measurement were sandwiched between lithium metal and stainless steel electrode in a test cell. And then the electrochemical stability was measured by using a liner sweep voltammetry at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> from 2.5 V to 6 V. The ionic conductivity and cell resistance were evaluated via AC impedance analyses (Zennium) over a frequency range from 1 Hz to 10
 <sup>6</sup> Hz and under an AC voltage of 10 mV. The ionic conductivity was then calculated by using formula: σ = L/R
 <sub>b</sub>A, where L was the thickness of the separator and A was the contact area between the separator and the stainless steel electrode, R
 <sub>b</sub> was the bulk resistance. The full coin cells (2032-type) with LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode, graphite anode and separator soaked with liquid electrolyte were assembled in a argon-filled glove box. The anode had a composition of 93 wt% graphite, 2 wt% carbon black, 1.5 wt% CMC and 3.5 wt% SBR as a polymeric binder. The cathode was composed of 90 wt% LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>, 5 wt% carbon black, and 5 wt% PVdF. The electrolyte was LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> (1 M) with ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 v/v). The rate capability and cycling stability were performed using a LAND battery testing system. The charge/discharge current densities were varied from 0.2 C (20 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>) to 8.0 C (800 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>) for rate capability under a voltage range between 2.75 V and 4.2 V. The cells were cycled at a fixed charge/discharge current density of 0.5 C (50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>)/0.5 C (50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>). A coil cell (2032-type) was assembled by sandwiching a separator between a lithium metal foil anode and a LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode and then filling liquid electrolyte. The LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode was composed of 90 wt% LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>, 10 wt% carbon black, and 5 wt% PVdF. The electrolyte was lithium bis(oxalate)borate LiBOB (1 M) with propylene carbonate (PC). Cycling stability of the cells was characterized using a LAND battery testing system at an elevated temperature of 120°C. The cells were cycled at a fixed charge/discharge current density of 0.5 C/0.5 C under a voltage range between 2.5 V and 4.0 V.
