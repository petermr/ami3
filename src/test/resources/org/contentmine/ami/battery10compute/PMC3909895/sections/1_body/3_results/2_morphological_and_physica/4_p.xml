<p>Lithium ion battery separator should be enough mechanically robust to withstand the high tension after casual collisions and prevent internal short-circuits caused by the rough electrode surface, debris and growth of lithium dendrite

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The stress-strain curves of PP separator, CN separator and FCCN separator were depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2</xref>. It was clearly demonstrated that FCCN separator exhibited an enhanced tensile strength of 45 MPa and deformation of 6.5%, which was much higher than that of CN separator (22 MPa with deformation of 3.5%). Obviously, the tensile strength of FCCN separator was much better than the transverse strength of PP separator (12 MPa) and lower than that of PP separator at the machine direction (120 MPa)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. PP separator was prepared via a uniaxially stretching technology. Different orientations at vertical and horizontal directions lead to the different tensile strength. However, FCCN separator was fabricated by papermaking process. The distribution of cellulose microfibers in FCCN separator was uniform, thus, tensile strength is same at both vertical and horizontal directions. In addition, sodium alginate and silica nanoparticles were used for bonding cellulose fiber, further enhancing the tensile strength of FCCN separator. So, the tensile strength of FCCN separator was much better than the transverse strength of PP separator (12 MPa) and lower than that of PP separator at the machine direction (120 MPa). Interestingly, FCCN separator has a considerably higher Young's modulus (690 MPa) than that of the PP separator (260 MPa). High Young's modulus is advantageous to remain mechanical integrity and avoid the rupture of the separator when it encounters accident crash
