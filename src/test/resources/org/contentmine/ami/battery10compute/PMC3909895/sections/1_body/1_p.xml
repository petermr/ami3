<p>From a practical point of view, an ideal separator should possess low cost, high electrolyte uptake, high thermal stability, excellent flame retardancy, proper mechanical strength which contributes to the superior battery performance. Moreover, with exhausted fossil oil and severe environmental pollution, renewable polymers are highly motivated as an alternative to polyolefin-based materials
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. It is well known that cellulose is one of the most abundant, renewable resources on the earth and possesses outstanding properties such as high dielectric constant, good chemical stability and superior thermal stability
