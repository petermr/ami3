<p>Thermal stability property of separators was another vital aspect about battery safety characteristic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. According to the DSC analysis shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>, the exothermic peak of polypropylene (PP) was related to the melting temperature of the material. The melting temperature of PP was 165°C, whereas the FCCN separator possessed superior thermal stability up to 300°C, which agreed well with the reported value in previous literature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. This implied that FCCN separator possessed better thermal stability than PP separator. This excellent thermal stability of FCCN separator might originate from the thermal resistance of cellulose. Therefore, FCCN separator has great potential in cells operating at an elevated temperature.
