<p>To investigate the variation of cell impedances during cycling, AC impedance measurement was carried out for LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphite cells assembled with PP separator and FCCN separator after the first cycle and after the 200 cycles test. It is well known that the semicircle at high frequency zone represents the charge-transfer resistance accompanied with migration of lithium ion between the electrode and electrolyte interface. The straight slopping line corresponds to the diffusion of lithium ion in the active material of electrode

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> that the charge-transfer resistance of the cell using FCCN separator after the first cycle was 20 Ω, which was very close to that of PP separator. It was quite obvious to observe from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5d</xref> that the charge-transfer resistance of the cell using FCCN separator after the 200 cycles test was 42 Ω, whereas that of the PP displayed 130 Ω. The better charge-transfer behavior of FCCN separator was directly related to excellent interface stability and improved electrolyte retention in FCCN separator
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Better rate capability and cycle performance of the cell with FCCN separator would be attributed to the limited cell impedance increase during long term cycling and improved electrolyte retention of FCCN separator.
