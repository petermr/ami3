<p>Herein, we presented a renewable, flame-retardant and thermal resistant cellulose-based composite nonwoven separator (hereinafter, abbreviated as “FCCN separator”) as LIB separator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scientific report that addresses highly flame-retardant FCCN separator of high-power LIB. Our results demonstrate that FCCN separator is a very promising separator to significantly improve the safety issue of LIB owing to its good flame retardancy, superior thermal stability and electrochemical characteristics. Another motivation of this work shed light on an ideal substituent of synthetic polymer derived from fossil oil by renewable polymer as clean energy material owing to its versatile diversity and easy processability.</p>
