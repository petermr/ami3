Overgaard, Nattapol Marasri1*† Theeraphap Chareonviriyaphap Abstract Background: ance in malaria vectors has been detected in a few countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region (GMS), representing a threat to malaria control and prevention. This study aims to determine the insecticide resistance status of mosquitoes in Ubon Ratchathani province, northeastern Thailand, where increasing number of malaria cases were reported recently. Methods:–2015 using human landing and cattle bait collections in six sites during both the rainy and dry seasons. Mosquitoes were first morphologically identified to species and their susceptibility status to deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%) and DDT (4%) investigated, according to WHO guidelines. Bioassays with the synergists PBO and DEF were carried out to address the role of detoxifying enzymes in insecticide resistance. DNA sequencing of a fragment of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was carried out to detect knock-down resistance (kdr) substitutions at position 1014 in resistant species. Results: hyrcanus DDT was found in Anopheles barbirostris and permethrin (mortality 100%). Although insufficient number of primary vectors were collected, results showed that Anopheles dirusAnopheles maculatus nivipesAnopheles philippinensis deltamethrin and permethrin in pyrethroid-resistant L1014F or L1014S mutation. Discussion: Thailand. The absence of kdrAnopheles mechanism of pyrethroid resistance. This study provides new findings about insecticide susceptibility status of potential malaria vectors in northeastern Thailand that are deemed important to guide malaria vector control.

  <span class="columnSpan">In 2015, an estimated 3.2 billion people in 97 countries were at risk of malaria [1]. In the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS), malaria foci are located in forested and rural areas and along country borders [2]. From these foci, malaria can spread to currently malaria free areas [3, 4]. The important economic and social implications caused by malaria in the region have prompted govern ments to make this disease a public health priority and to implement integrated national malaria control programs adapted to the specific needs of their individual coun tries [5]. In Thailand, the number of malaria cases has decreased substantially since the 2000s, but the disease remains a major cause of morbidity for people living in border areas (i.e. about 32 million people) [6]. Vector control has played an essential role in the reduc tion of malaria in Thailand and the country has entered into the pre-elimination phase [7]. At present, vector control relies mainly on indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Indoor residual spraying with deltamethrin once or twice a year is applied following the guidelines and malaria stratification system of the national malaria control programme [8]. Accord ing to the 2015 annual malaria report of the Bureau of Vector Borne Disease (BVBD), bifenthrin and alphacypermethrin have also been used for IRS, whereas permethrin and deltamethrin are the two main pyrethroids used for ITNs [8]. Unfortunately, the repeated use of the same insecticides in public health and for agricultural purposes has con tributed to selection for insecticide resistance in malaria vector populations worldwide [5, 9, 10]. Although the situation is less worrying in South East Asia than in Africa [9], insecticide resistance is on the rise and may pose increasing challenges to malaria control and elimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends member countries to implement an active system of insecticide resistance monitoring of vectors to improve preventive strategies and achieve malaria elimination [11]. A Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Manage ment (GPIRM) has been developed and was released in May 2012 by the WHO. The strategies of IRM aim to preserve insecticide susceptibility, slow down the spread of insecticide resistance when its already present and develop new approaches for sustainable vector control [12]. All countries in the GMS have set national malaria elimination goals to eliminate malaria by 2030 [7]. In the GMS, Van Bortel et  aal. previously reported resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin and suspected resist ance to alpha-cypermethrin in Anopheles dirus stricto (s.s.) in central Vietnam.

  <span class="columnSpan">genes, CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3, suspected to metabolize some pyrethroids [19], have been found in a deltamethrin-resistant population of An. minimus20, 21]. Between 2000 and 2010, resistance to DDT was detected in Anopheles annularisAn. minimus in the northwestern part of the country [22]. The primary vectors, An. dirusAn. minimusAnopheles maculatus ticides, except in the northern part of the country (Chang Mai province) where deltamethrin, cyfluthrin, and malathion resistance was detected in An. minimus Ubon Ratchathani province is located in the northeast of Thailand along the Cambodia and Lao PDR borders. In 2014, there was a malaria outbreak in the province, recording the highest number of malaria cases compared to all other provinces [23]. The majority of malaria cases are consistently being reported from four districts in the province, namely Buntharik, Nachaluay, Nam Yuen and Khong Chiam [23]. Successful implementation of malaria vector control strategies in Ubon Ratchathani requires recent information on the status of insecticide resistance in Anopheles resistance to insecticides conventionally used for malaria vector control in this region. The current study aimed at characterizing the status and mechanisms of insecticide resistance to public health insecticides in Anopheles quitoes to guide malaria vector control. Study site Mosquitoes were collected from seven sites in five districts in Ubon Ratchathani province: (a) Ban Pakla, Khong Chiam district (15°°338.822′N–105°°337.968 (b) Ban Talong, Khong Chiam district (15°°224.313′N–105°°333.801′E), (c) Ban Payaka, Sirindhorn district (14°°558.821′N–105°°331.097′E), (d) Ban Nongmek, Buntharik district (14°°335.454′N–105°°222.505′E), (e) Ban Sanghom, Buntharik district (14°°334.578′N–105°°221.615 (f) a rubber plantation in Nachalauy district; and (g) Chong Ta Ou, a border patrol police camp in Buntharik district (14°°442.309′N–105°°331.053′E) (Fig.  11). These sites were selected based on the high prevalence of malaria and being located near the Lao border with high risk fac tors for infection, such as presence of forests, high-risk occupations and poor knowledge prevention practice [23]. Additional mosquito collections were carried out in September 2015 to strengthen the effort to collect spe cific forest-associated malaria vectors, particularly dirus An. hyrcanus The additional collections were done in four locations: (1) Methods</span>

Mosquitoes collected in the last two sites were used to assess metabolic resistance mecha-nisms by using synergists. Residents living in these areas are mainly farmers, involved in rice production, rubber, forestry and non-wood forest product collection.-Between September 2013 and September 2015, five ento4, 21].mological surveys were carried out. Mosquito collections were carried out twice a year during both the dry and rainy seasons using indoor and outdoor human-landing (HLC) and cow bait collections (CBC) [24] (Table  11). In each village, one site was used for the CBC and four houses were used for HLC (both inside and outside the same house). Collections were carried out from 06.00 p.m. to 06.00 a.m. for four consecutive nights per sur-vey (equivalent to 16 person-nights collections per vil-lage for HLC and 4 cow-nights collections per village for CBC). The HLC lasted for 45  mmin each hour followed by a 15  mmin break for collectors. Human catch sites were located minimum 30  mm from each other to avoid poten-tial bias in attracting mosquitoes. The CBC involved plac-ing a single adult cow inside an enclosure made of clean -(untreated) cotton bed net measuring approximately 20  mm in length and 1.5  mm in height with the net sus-pended 30  ccm above the ground level to allow mosquito access [25]. The cow net was placed approximately 100  mm from the nearest HLC to avoid interference in mosquito attractiveness. The cow was exposed to mosquitoes entering the net uninterrupted for 45  mmin each hour, and 337.968′E), then mosquitoes were collected for 15  mmin every hour by a collector using an aspirator. Mosquitoes landing on humans or resting on the net, at time of collection, were caught individually by aspirators or glass tubes. Collected mosquitoes were kept in a clean plastic cup covered with 221.615′E), netting and provided with 10% sugar solution soaked on cotton. Cups were then brought back to the field station for further processing. All collection sites were geo-refer-enced using a Global Positioning System unit.All female Anophelesphologically identified to species or species complex using stereomicroscopes and morphological keys [26]. -Mosquitoes were then separated by species group, com-An. plex or species for bioassays.

Mosquitoes were exposed for 60  mmin in tubes placed in vertical position. All con trol and insecticide-impregnated papers were supplied by the Vector Control Research Unit, Universiti Sains Malaysia and were not used more than four times. During exposure, the number of knocked-down mos quitoes was recorded every 5  mmin until 60  mmin. After 1  hh exposure, mosquitoes were put in plastic cups with sugar solution and maintained for 24  hh. The number of knocked-down mosquitoes and percentage mortality after 24  hh were recorded. The susceptibility tests were carried out at 24–33  °CC and 52–85% relative humid ity. Mosquito samples were stored individually in 1.5  mml microtubes with silica gel and kept at −20 molecular tests. In order to explore the involvement of detoxifying enzymes in the resistant phenotype, synergist bioassays were performed when sufficient number of mosquitoes could be collected (September 2015). Two synergists, 0.25% S.S.S-tributyl phosphotritioate (DEF), an inhibi tor of esterases and 4% pyperonyl butoxide (PBO), an inhibitor of oxidases were used in this study [27 ferent concentrations of synergists have been tested in various field studies, for example a 4% PBO concentration was used to test a range of Anopheles Lanka [28], and 4% PBO and 0.25% DEF were used on Anopheles gambiae29]. Experiments were done in the Entomology Lab at Kasetsart Univer sity using these concentrations to establish whether the same minimum concentrations could be used for Southeast Asian mosquitoes. The same concentrations of each synergist were assessed to be suitable, since they did not kill a laboratory strain of Anopheles minimus (sub-lethal dose).

  <span class="columnSpan">female mosquitoes were used in the bioassays. As temperature can influence the toxicity of insecticides and relative humidity can affect mosquito survival, bioassays were performed in a shaded area and tubes were placed in a container covered with a wet towel in sheltered loca tion. However, under the field condition, temperatures and humidity can vary considerably depending on the environment, so these factors may have impacted on mosquito mortality in bioassay tests. The relative role of insecticides from agriculture and vector control in the selection of insecticide resistance is difficult to address. In agricultural areas, intensive use of pesticides was suspected to select for multiple resistance in a broad range of malaria vector species [9, 38]. In Ubon Ratchathani, most people work in the agricultural sector, especially growing rice as an eco nomic crop, which covers large areas. It is also one of largest chili growing regions in Thailand [55]. Pesticides are routinely used to prevent insect damage and enhance market quality. The common pesticide classes in use are organophosphates such as chlorpyrifos and profenofos and a variety of pyrethroids [56, 57]. Insec ticide resistance is most likely a result of both vector control and the expansion and intensification of agriculture with associated pesticides [13, 38]. Much work has to be done to understand the impact of agricultural practices on insecticide resistance selection to implement resistance management strategies [13]. Collaboration between agricultural and public health sectors is required to develop effective integrated pest and vector management interventions. The Global Vector Control Response, adopted by the 70th World Health Assembly in May 2017 advocate increased intra- and intersectoral collaboration and action for sustaining vector control and contribute to better management of public health pesticides [58]. This study showed that pyrethroid resistance is present in Ubon Ratchathani, but rather limited to secondary malaria vector species. Achieving universal coverage and proper use of LLIN for all people at risk of the disease is still a priority. However, conventional strategies (i.e. LLIN and IRS) may not be optimal to protect people in this region who often work or sleep outdoors at night (e.g. rubber plantation workers, forest goers, sleeping in field huts) and are being exposed to exophagic mosquito vectors [59]. Indeed a recent serological study conducted along the Thai-Myanmar border showed that human antibody response to malaria vector bites was not sig nificantly different between users and non-users of ITNs, Conclusions</span>

Alternative control tools (e.g. insecticide treated clothes, spatial repellents or treated hammocks, etc.) adapted to the situation of people’s activities may be more effec--tive to reduce the malaria burden [4, 62]. The magnitude and causes of residual transmission in malaria hotspots located in forested border areas, rubber plantations, log-ging camps, etc. should be further monitored through a combination of entomological, social, and epidemiologi-cal surveys. Continued monitoring of insecticide suscep-tibility and generating complementary data on resistance intensity to measure potential changes in the strength of resistance to public health pesticides is essential to ensure early detection of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in the region.].
