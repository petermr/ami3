Protection Information Section '/>

<entry id="" term="Enforcement and Implementation (Control) Mechanisms" desc='the system for monitoring 
implementation and enforcing international human 
rights law is very diffe
rent from how states 
enforce their domestic laws. The former relies heavily
 on political pressure, a
nd it is the state, not 
individuals, which are responsible for human right
s violations. The two principle ways to treat 
human rights violations within the UN system ar
e on the one hand the enforcement and complaint 
procedures established by each convention, and on 
the other by approaching some of the other UN 
agencies and offices that focus on human rights.
 Complaint mechanisms exist independent from 
whether a country has ratified a human rights convention'/>

and fundamental group unit of society, as descri
bed in Art 16 of the Un

application of the family unity principle, th
ey are said to enjoy “derivative status”'/>

<entry id="" term="Family Reunification" desc='The process of bringing together families, particularly children and 
elderly dependents with previous

refugees are addressed without previously dete
rmining their status on an individual basis.

recognition of refugee status on a prima facie 
basis and the provision of temporary protection'/>

<entry id="" term="Group Determination of Refugee Status" desc='A practice by which all persons forming part of a large-

prima facie 
basis. Group determination ensures that 
protection and assistance needs are met without
 prior individual status determination'/>

common problems to humanitarian actors, and administering coordination mech
anisms and tools. It does not involve OCHA in the administration of humanitarian assistance'/>

<entry id="" term="Internal Flight Alternative"
 desc='(or “Relocation Principle”): A factual determination that an asylum-seeker could have avoided persecution in his country of origin by relocating to another part of the

determination procedures or to deny refugee st
