[MTMI] doesn't exist : "the font MTMI is a virtual one, combining characters
 from Times Italic with additional characters (such as an italic
 letter v looking less like the Greek letter nu) contained in a font
 RMTMI."

<!-- appears that names take priority over charvals 
e.g. 
<character charval="5" charname="Delta1" font="MTMI"/> 
<character charval="946" charname="null" font="MTMI"/>

the charname appears to take precedence over the charval
