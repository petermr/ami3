 * 2-dimensional point class

 * Point2 represents a 2-dimensional point. It is one of a set of primitives
 * which can be combined to create and manipulate complex 2-dimensional objects.
 * Points can be transformed with rotation matrices or rotation-translation
 * matrices (Transform2), can be calculated from other primitives or can be used
 * to generate other primitives.
 * 
 * Default point is 0.0, 0.0
