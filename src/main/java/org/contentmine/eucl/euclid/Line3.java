/**
 * 3-dimensional line class
 * 
 * Line3 represents a 3-dimensional line It is one of a set of primitives which
 * can be combined to create and manipulate complex 3-dimensional objects. Lines
 * can be transformed with rotation matrices or rotation-translation matrices
 * (Transform3), can be calculated from other primitives or can be used to
 * generate other primitives.
 * 
 * 
 * A line is a vector which is located in space. It is described by a unit
 * vector (vector) and a point (p) on the line. Any point on the line can be used for
 * p, and p could change during the existence of a calculation without affecting
 * the integrity of the line, for example p = {1,1,1}, vector = {1,0,0} is the same
 * line as p = {2,1,1}, vector = {1,0,0}. However the absolute direction of vector IS
 * important, giving the line a direction.
 * 
 * Default is a default Point3 (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and default Vector3 (0.0, 0.0,
 * 0.0). Operations on this line may lead to Exceptions such as
 * ZeroLengthVector.
