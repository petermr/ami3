## Summary

AMI summary: Aggregating sections over corpus

## Changes in this Release
- ami `summary` accepts --glob to identify (sub)sections
- ami `summary` creates a new toplevel directory `_summary` with aggregated subtrees. The
directory structure tries to mirror the original structures. See AMISummaryTest for
example.
